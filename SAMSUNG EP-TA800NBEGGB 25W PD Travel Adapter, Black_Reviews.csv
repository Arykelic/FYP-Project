It seems that you don't need these (along with an SD card slot)' in a bid to be more "eco friendly" you have to buy a charger' and the best part is the cable that comes in the box of the phone is a USB-C to USB-C so being eco friendly and expecting you to use the old charger to charge your phone isn't going to work because your old one more than likely has a USB-A outlet on it.So being eco friendly' they now have to box up separate chargers and ship them separately and then that means I have two deliveries instead of one and that's messing up the planet more. Perhaps its the fact you have to buy the charger means the profit per device is more... if the phones really were eco friendly then they would make sure you could remove battery yourself with simple tools' but they don't want you to do that not when you can buy a new phone... creating e-waste with out a charger and charge you more for one' see where this is going...Any how' this wallops the power in to the phone it works with the Galaxy S21 and the S20 Ultra in Superfast Charging mode' so within 40 minutes you're almost full.I purchased mine from Amazon direct' I don't trust the sellers' I have purchased from them before and I don't really want to burn my curtains down' set fire to my kitchen or incinerate my cat when I am asleep' as they generally sell counterfeit ones and you cannot tell until either you open it with someone who is electronically trained (like me) or the fire and rescue service arrive.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 March 2021
https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/214cOlKM6PL._AC_US60_SCLZZZZZZZ__.jpg,SAMSUNG EP-TA800NBEGGB 25W PD Travel Adapter| Black,Ronnie,5.0 ,I was concerned that this may be a poor or cheap knock off.  No worries' proper Samsung seals and part numbers.The main test was in the charging rate.  I mated this 25w USB C TO C PD unit with an Anker 60w PD USB C to C cable.  My Samsung Galaxy A51 5G was at 20% charge when the unit was delivered.  I always only charge to a max of 85% and this charger with the Anker cable hit that from 20% in 52 minutes!That'll do me.  No overheating' no warmth.Recommended.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 January 2021

Product is a genuine samsung charger ideal for taking with you as its a travel charger.When plugged into my S21 superfast charging started so no problems at all although samsung could have included it with a phone costing over ¬£1000 if you need a charger for the S20 or S21 superfast charging then best buying this genuine samsung charger,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 February 2021
https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/214cOlKM6PL._AC_US60_SCLZZZZZZZ__.jpg,SAMSUNG EP-TA800NBEGGB 25W PD Travel Adapter| Black,Ahmad,1.0 ,Amazon seems to be sourcing these chargers from multiple sources and some people' myself included' ended up getting counterfeit products.The charger I got was in a wrinkled' partially torn plastic zip bag.The charger looks identical to the older genuine one I have in almost every aspect but here are the differences I found:1. The counterfeit charger is significantly lighter in hand' and hollow sounding on tapping.2. The text on the genuine charger is printed using raised ink (more expensive to fake). On the counterfeit one' the text is more faint and not raised.3. When I first plugged it into the socket' I heard a puff sound. Immediately unplugged' and started the return process.(Just look at the terrifying photos of burnt sockets and exploded chargers)Shame on Amazon letting dangerous electrical equipment slip into customers' hands. Many people wouldn't be able to tell the difference until its too late. Amazon should email affected users and recall those fakes and apologise.(See my photo' genuine charger is the one with the cable connected - look at the difference in text print quality),Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 July 2021
https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/214cOlKM6PL._AC_US60_SCLZZZZZZZ__.jpg,SAMSUNG EP-TA800NBEGGB 25W PD Travel Adapter| Black,Alex,1.0 ,While when it worked' it worked well' I only had it for 11 days before it blew up in my socket and broke' not to mention short circuiting the entirety of the upstairs outlets.I first presumed that it was something to do with that plug socket' but' after reading similar reviews' I realised that it's not uncommon with this product. Of course' I'd recommend doing some research on what other people have found' but I certainly won't be buying this again.I'd recommend buying from a different seller' or from Samsung itself. Not worth risking a fire for the sake of a couple of bucks. Please don't buy.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 August 2021
https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/214cOlKM6PL._AC_US60_SCLZZZZZZZ__.jpg,SAMSUNG EP-TA800NBEGGB 25W PD Travel Adapter| Black,SMH77,5.0 ,Having just bought a new S21 Ultra' I already knew the charger was needed. After criticising Apple for removing their chargers and ear buds from new purchases it is ironical that Samsung has quietly followed suit for their latest series of smartphones. And to make matters worse the cable supplied with the phone is USB-C to USB-C which invalidates Samsung chargers more than two years old!Samsung has at least reduced prices for their chargers. Although purchasing one is no straightforward task these days. My phone provider is EE and would not sell me one in the shop. I guess they are keeping their stock for new customers who take out costly new phone and contract plans. Other places like Argos were out of stock although had the standard price of ¬£17.99 at least. And I have seen online prices as high as ¬£29.99 which is frankly ludicrous.I purchased this (PD 3.0 PPS Max 25 W) charger during the Prime Day sales and it cost ¬£14. I made sure that it was sold by Amazon directly' as there are many reviews for chargers bought indirectly from Amazon that mention lack of packaging and suspicions of the item not being genuine. I am  happy that what I received is the real deal and at a very good price.A full charge from 5% took around 68mins. 50% is achievable in 30mins. This may not seem great but it is a 25W charger after all' despite the super fast charging branding.The benefits of buying a 25W charger over a 15W charger are negligible. You are talking a saving of a few minutes. It is well known that fast charging increases battery degradation. One of the reasons that Samsung has stopped support for their 45W chargers. So there is an argument that the Samsung 15W charger is a better and cheaper option. However' overall I  happy with this item and would buy again. Although at no more than the standard price.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 June 2021

Since I thought it was a genuine Samsung item as the item title suggests' I contacted Samsung Customer support. I shared how it happened and its serial number. After 2 days they came back and told me it is not one of their serial numbers' and that this was not manufactured by Samsung. In the product support page it direct me to Samsung UK as the provider of manufacturing cover. This product poses great safety issues. Luckily it was behind a chest of drawers when it exploded and the only damage it made was on the original Samsung charging cable and it left a black stain on the wall plug. The fuse blew' which protected my phone. I was assured Amazon will take action to stop selling this.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2022

I am really disappointed as I have been a amazon customer for a long time and this is the first time that I have bought which is obviously faulty. I will have to buy a new one somewhere else probably in a shop so that I definitely get one that is in its original packaging.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 July 2021

The odds are that if you get a new phone' then you probably will need a new charger that produces the right output.Samsung has unfortunately joined the trend. Luckily the price for this genuine Samsung charger isn't too extortionate.  This one is perfect for the Galaxy S21. But let's be honest' it should have been in the box with the phone. There unfortunately are a lot of fakes out there so buying a charger is not that straight-forward.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 January 2022
