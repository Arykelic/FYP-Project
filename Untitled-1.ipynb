      "Review_Description: Tengo pr√°cticamente una semana con el equipo y no me arrepiento de nada, vengo de un galaxy s8+ y el salto es muy bueno, quer√≠a un s20+ pero despu√©s de tantos videos de an√°lisis que v√≠ me decid√≠ por este s20 fe ya que no le pide nada al plus, solo el tema de que la parte de atr√°s es de pl√°stico pero seamos sinceros la mayor√≠a lo ocupar√° con funda as√≠ que estar√°s poco en contacto con esa parte. Voy por partes:Tiene: carga inal√°mbrica, carga reversible, snapdragon 865, resistente al agua y polvo, 6 de ram, 128 de almacenamiento, tasa de refresco 120, pantalla Amoled, bater√≠a 4500 mha, Cargador \"mexicano\" pero de 15w yo te recomiendo que compres uno de 25w cuando hagas tu pedido para que tengas carga s√∫per r√°pida ya que es lo que admite el tel√©fono, la entrada es USB c, trae pinchito, admite tarjeta SD, solo un SIM, si se puede usar en M√©xico sin problema yo lo ocupo con Telcel sin problema.No tiene: pantalla curva que en mi caso agradezco ya que algunas √°reas en las pantallas curvas son dif√≠ciles de alcanzar, me pasaba mucho con mi s8+, no trae funda por lo que recomiendo que compres una al mismo tiempo que hagas tu pedido del celular para que cuando te llegue tu equipo puedas usarlo con su funda y est√©s m√°s seguro üòä. No tiene entrada de aud√≠fonos 3.5 por lo que si no tienes audifonos Bluetooth vayas pensando en comprar uno o comprar un adaptador, para m√≠ no es ning√∫n problema ya que los aud√≠fonos no los ocupo casi.Env√≠o: me tardo en llegar una semana pr√°cticamente pero todo dentro de los d√≠as que me marc√≥ desde el inicio la fecha de llegada, pudo haber llegado antes pero en mi caso DHL no llega directo a mi ciudad si no que hace reconexi√≥n, pero todo eso est√° contemplado en la fecha de llegada as√≠ que todo bien. La caja lleg√≥ en buenas condiciones y toda sellada nada abierta solo un poquito arrugadita de una esquina pero se entiende por el manejo de la mensajer√≠a, nada agrave pr√°cticamente imperceptible.Pago: pague lo que marca el precio en el anuncio, no tuve que pagar nada m√°s ya que parece que los gastos de manejo vienen inclu√≠do en el precio anunciado, en M√©xico sin ser 5g y sin el procesador snapdragon el tel√©fono est√° en unos 16 mil y lo que pague que fueron $13,200 es un s√∫per precio considerando que es 5g y trae el snapdragon.Rendimiento: lo he usado con los 120 hzs y me ha durado todo el d√≠a la bater√≠a, lleg√≥ con un 20% a las 9 pm. Creo que es un rendimiento bueno pero no el mejor considerando que juego pr√°cticamente nada al d√≠a, mi mayor uso son las redes sociales, correo y aplicaciones del trabajo pero las ocupo mucho que compensa esa parte del juego as√≠ que no creo tengas problema para terminar tu d√≠a con algo de bater√≠a y si no una cargadita de 20 minutos y listo. El rendimiento ha sido de unas 7.5 horas de pantalla encendida.C√°maras: si considero que ven√≠a de un s8+ el salto ha sido muy grande, las c√°maras tienen muy buena calidad y nada que envidiar al s20+ si no me crees ve los videos de rese√±as y ver√°s que no hay mucha diferencia por lo mucho m√°s que pagas en el plus creo que el FE tiene mejor calidad precio.En resumen es un buen telefono, me gusta mucho el m√≥dulo de c√°maras, el color que eleg√≠ fue el azul y me agrad√≥ mucho, se siente como un premium y luce como un premium, yo pensaba en darle una oportunidad a un Xiaomi, realme, poco etc pero seamos sinceros Samsung es Samsung y si trae un snapdragon es mucho mejor, estoy seguro que los Specs suenan fabulosos en otras marcas pero no creo que su calidad de equipo aguante el pasar de los a√±os, yo uso los tel√©fonos un promedio de 3 a√±os, siempre Samsung y los he dejado pr√°cticamente como nuevos. As√≠ que si quieres un tel√©fono bueno, bonito y que te dure unos a√±os este es tu opci√≥n ideal, no te vas arrepentir.\n",

      "Review_Description: I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I've done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You'll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can't beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you've been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I'd say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn't, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it's not flagship levels by any stretch. You'll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you're looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I'd look elsewhere.From what I've seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There's undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I'm sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven't noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that's about all I've seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don't blame you.It really is a shame that I can't give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there's always the worry that time will make them worse. It's a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I'm more than happy with it.Edit (8/18/2021): I've dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It's been a little less than a year, and the issues mentioned above have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay, maybe not daily use, per se. But enough that it's starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket, it's opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen, as suspected. This is a pure hardware messup.Here's the cold, honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone's screen. It's beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic \"angry Amazon customer 1-star\" review, but I'll refrain. There's still good here with the chip, customizability, and great battery life, but that stuff can only get you so far.Here's my advice: don't bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price, with better specs. It's still not the worst thing out there and I'm not tossing it in the trash just yet, but it's definitely the last Samsung product I'll be buying. So disappointing, but I couldn't keep this review a 4-star in good conscience.\n",

      "Review_Description: El tel√©fono lleg√≥ super r√°pido y lo compr√© por un excelente precio $13,500 m√°s o menos.La pantalla es muy buena y no le pide nada a los otros modelos s20. En tanto a la pantalla lo √∫nico que me ha pasado es que un par de veces despu√©s de desbloquearlo no reconoce mis gestos o cuando toco la pantalla en algunas partes, desconozco el por qu√©. Fuera de eso me funciona de maravilla la respuesta tanto que juego COD mobile.El sonido es muy bueno porque tiene un par de bocinas con sonido est√©reo que te hacen tener una gran experiencia al consumir contenido multimedia.Los m√©todos de seguridad funcionan bien, nada del otro mundo pero bien. Sigo prefiriendo el lector de huella f√≠sico que el que tiene integrado pero tarda un par de segundos en responder. El desbloqueo facial es bueno pero podr√≠a ser mejor.Las c√°maras soy muy buenas y puedes grabar a 60 fps en 4k, en esta configuraci√≥n no tiene estabilizaci√≥n pero para una toma est√°tica va de maravilla. La c√°mara frontal es muy buena y reconoce el rostro para saber si tiene que ampliar la toma en dado caso que detecte dos rostros.La bater√≠a, 45000 mAh dan super bien para un d√≠a de uso empezando desde las 8 AM hasta al rededor de las 10 de la noche cuando ya est√°s en casa y lo puedes comenzar a cargar. El cargador que viene de f√°brica en mi caso fue el tipo americano de 15w y carga suficientemente r√°pido. Lo anterior con la pantalla a 60 Hz. No he podido probar la pantalla un d√≠a completo o una carga completa en 120 Hz.El rendimiento es bueno, 6 gb de ram son buenos aunque con 8 ser√≠a perfecto. A√∫n as√≠ el snapdragon hace un gran trabajo en el rendimiento, no se traba jugando o navegando, no se calienta por el uso, claro siempre y cuando le des un uso normal.Los contras que le encuentro al tel√©fono es que s√≠ extra√±o el Jack de 3.5 mm para los auriculares, tengo que ocupar unos Bluetooth que tengo. Es dif√≠cil encontrar accesorios cheveres y una mica espec√≠fica para la pantalla porque a√∫n es un tel√©fono relativamente nuevo. Quiero resaltar que aun con una mica de cristal templado lee bien mi huella pero el cristal que consegu√≠ no le qued√≥ a la perfecci√≥n a√∫n as√≠ el chiste es que lo proteja.Los pros o puntos a favor son demasiados por todo el extra que ofrece adem√°s de las cosas buenas que ya mencione. Samsung te ofrece grandes cosas como la carga reversible e inalambrica, filtro de luz azul (es buen√≠simo para la vista y lo recomiendo), conexi√≥n a Windows (tiene alianza con Windows haciendo que sea muy f√°cil vincular el tel√©fono con un equipo de computo Windows y poder recibir notificaciones, hacer llamadas, transmitir la pantalla del tel√©fono en la computadora, etc), Dex (vuelve tu tel√©fono como una laptop), puedes grabar la pantalla del tel√©fono directamente desde los accesos directos y la barra edge deslizando desde un costado de la pantalla, tambi√©n se ilumina el borde de la pantalla con las notificaciones que configures entre muchas cosas m√°s. Es una gran opci√≥n y lo recomiendo.\n",

Llego el equipo en buenas condiciones y totalmente sellado, con su cargador y su cable.  Decid√≠ comprar este producto liberado ya que seg√∫n tengo entendido viene con la versi√≥n de Snapdragon. Al venir de un celular de huawei (y al no tener acceso a las aplicaciones de Google) opte por comprar un Samsung de tal manera que ya habia tenido Galaxy S3 hace bastantes a√±os. Estoy fascinado con su pantallas amoled (caracter√≠stico de Samsung) su calidad de imagen y video, sin olvidar su fluidez ya que cuenta con 120hz (ajustable a 60hz). Me encuentro satisfecho con la compra, sin embargo, el unico \"pero\" que le pongo es... He le√≠do otros comentarios que hablan de un \"buen rendimiento'' y sinceramente por horario de trabajo le he dado un uso b√°sico, visitas a redes sociales espont√°neas durante el d√≠a. Siendo ya la 5 pm tengo menos de un 55% de bateria tomando en cuenta que casi no lo uso en horario de trabajo.

      "Review_Description: Mi celular pasado era un Xiaomi, con las mismas caracter√≠sticas de almacenamiento 6GB y 128GB, solo que el Snapdragon  de este samsung es de 865, y la verdad no siento el cambio sustancial en cuanto al rendimiento, se siente igual de r√°pido. Puedo decir que no siento que sea de mejor calidad este Samsung que un Xiaomi con las mismas caracter√≠sticas.Otra cosa es la c√°mara, las selfies di mi otro cel ten√≠a 20MP de la c√°mara frontal y √©ste es de 32MP, hice la comparaci√≥n de las tomas y me gustaban m√°s como sal√≠an en mi Xiaomi.Lo que no le discuto a este cel es la c√°mara trasera, es buena, pero se calienta much√≠simo el tel√©fono al usar la c√°mara.Para terminar, siento que la pila no me dura mucho ni por que le activ√© el modo de ahorro de energ√≠a y tampoco uso el cel para jugar, no tengo ning√∫n juego en mi cel.Y por el precio, la verdad me ubiera comprado otro xiaomi con mejor rendimiento, pero quise probar el samsung por sus c√°maras y la verdad es que no vale la pena por la c√°mara. Quise regresar el cel pero en Amazon dec√≠a que este producto no era elegible para devoluci√≥n.Otro punto malo es que no tiene grabador de voz, tuve que bajar una aplicaci√≥n gratis que tiene muchos anuncios buuu. Estoy decepcionada de este cel.\n",

      "Review_Description: S√≠, este equipo cuenta con el procesador Snapdragon 865 y con 5G, lo ped√≠ directamente a Amazon M√©xico y viene con un cargador de 15W dentro de la caja.Ped√≠ el color lavanda y aunque un sector se quej√≥ de que la tapa es de pl√°stico ni siquiera se nota, al tacto se siente de un material muy bueno y semi premium que le queda excelente y el color lavanda se ve hermoso.Ahora hablando del rendimiento, es muy potente. Me corre juegos pesados con una fluidez que asombra, no he tenido ning√∫n problema de sobrecalentamiento y las pocas veces que aument√≥ su temperatura, baj√≥ muy r√°pido.La bater√≠a, dependiendo del uso que le des y la fluidez que tengas activada en la pantalla (120 hz o 60hz), puede variar entre 7 y hasta 10 horas de pantalla, en mi caso es suficiente para llegar al final del d√≠a (siempre tengo encendidos los 120Hz y hasta el Bluetooth y la bater√≠a no se drena r√°pido).La c√°mara trasera es muy buena para foto y video, aunque la frontal para selfies pudo ser mejor, pero no me quejo mucho ya que hace un trabajo aceptable.Sin duda es el mejor celular que he tenido.\n",

      "Review_Description: El celular no defrauda realmente, cumple con todas tus espectativas es muy potente y eficiente, se siente el poder de su procesador snapdragon 865 y la eficiencia de la bater√≠a es formidable te dura todo 1 jornada laboral de 8 horas sin ning√∫n problema llegas a tu casa f√°cilmente con el 30 a 35% de bater√≠a con un uso frecuente del dispositivo durante el d√≠a. te permite saltar de aplicacion en aplicacion r√°pidamente y navegar por ellas sin qu√© el dispositivo se alente en ning√∫n momento, se calienta muy poco a excepci√≥n de los juegos ah√≠ suele subir considerablemente su temperatura pero no es de una manera exagerada. Las c√°maras son excelentes y cuentan con una resoluci√≥n e interpretaci√≥n de colores muy balanceados y el modo noche es una maravilla las fotos en cuartos muy oscuros las saca tan claras como si fuera de d√≠a.Pero como dije el celular no decepciona el qu√© decepciona es el estado en el qu√© lo env√≠an, ya que desde que habres la caja te das cuenta que no protegen de movimientos o golpes bruscos a la caja del dispositivo qu√© viene dentro y va totalmente suelto. De ah√≠ una vez qu√© sacas tu articulo te das cuenta que ya ha sido habierto ya que la caja d√≥nde viene el celular no tra√≠a los sellos oficles de Samsung, si no m√°s bien un sello com√∫n y corriente que puedes conseguir en una papeler√≠a, una vez que rompes dichos sellos y abres la caja para ver tu celular y revisas los documentos que suelen traer un celular \"nuevo\" te das cuenta qu√© la garant√≠a del dispositivo no viene dentro, reafirmando una vez m√°s que la caja fue abierta antes. Despu√©s de 20 d√≠as de uso del celular el bot√≥n de BLOQUEO/ENCENDIDO, se comienza  aflojar y se termina cayendo dejando al bot√≥n incerbible. y sin la hoja de garant√≠a dentro de la caja te ponen en un grave predicamento ya que no puedes exigirle una garant√≠a a Samsung porque no cuentas con la hoja. afortunadamente √©sto me sucedi√≥ antes de cumplirse el mes de oportunidad que te da Amazon para regresarlo y pude devolver el equip√≥ pidiendo mi reembolso, pero si esto hubiera pasado despu√©s del mes y sin la hoja de la garant√≠a del celular hubiera tirado 14 mil pesos a la basura. Revisen bien como llega el celular y chequen si su articulo lleva la garant√≠a y si no es as√≠ usen y pongan aprueba su celular de manera intesa para detectar los defectos r√°pidamente y est√©n a tiempo de pedir el reembolso de su dinero.\n",

      "Review_Description: This was the perfect phone until I started wondering what was wrong with my screen. Your touchs will be misread causing random inputs and jitter. This is a recording of how the phone is recognizing my inputs when using two fingers in alternating succession as well as when swiping with two fingers. This effects everyday use in subtle but frustrating ways. From taps being read as scrolling to unplayable multitouch games, the screen makes me miss my 3 year old galaxy S8. The most recent software update to fix the issue has made no difference. If you buy this phone it WILL have this problem. I was originally in the group that assumed mine wasn't affected, but it became hard to ignore the signs after a week.\n",

      "Review_Description: This phone seemed like it had it all for an unbeatable price of $550. Big battery, 120 hz, good cameras, recent cpu, and okay ram. Well all this stuff would have made this phone a keeper except the touch screen issues. This is literally how the user communicates with the phone and allows you to access all these great features. Really stinks that an issue this big slipped through. Samsung has released 3 software updates trying to fix it, but still have problems with jittery scrolling, accidental touches, etc. This isn't something that can be fixed with an update in my opinion or it would be resolved by now. Look elsewhere, or if your brave chance it I guess. I thought I would get lucky despite all the bad reviews/complaints (check samsung forums). I don't mean to be a downer but I strongly advise to choose a different phone. I'm still looking myself. Good luck!\n",

The phone also appeared to have been used as it had scratches in the end and was missing the sim card key. Am returning the phone.\n",

      "Review_Description: To give some context, I'm coming from a Galaxy S7.FYI, I read some of the bad reviews. Most are widely inaccurate.Pros- Easy setup: I'm on Verizon and all I had to do was swap the sim card. I didn't have to take the phone to store, I didn't have to log in and change settings, etc.- The 120hz OLED screen is game changing (for me). I'm gamer and I could immediately notice how fast and responsive the panel is. Colors are vibrant and blacks are inky inky black.- Processor is light years ahead of S7. It's also running the 20 series flagship processor.- Camera is amazing.  3x zoom and wide lens. Yesss please.- I love the colors. I got the Orange.- Samsung's OneUI is a huge improvement. Very intuitive and very powerful. I've been setting up advanced Bixby routines. I honestly never thought i would use Bixby but I'm a believer now.- Larger screen and battery than the S20- Very fast and responsive finger print scanner- Dual sim cards and up to 1TB of additional storage if you buy a micro sd card. I'm looking at you APPLE. Although Samsung will be removing the sd card storage slot for S21's for some reason.- Comes with a charger. APPLE!Cons- Face recognition is too slow for my liking. The finger print reader is more than adequate.- No 3mm headphone jack- Out of the box charger is not the best. You get a 15 watt charger even though this phone can handle 25 watts.In summary, if you can get this phone for 550 to 600 bucks... BUY IT.\n",

      "Review_Description: The screen on this phone will randomly stop accepting touch inputs and then at other points it will click when trying to scroll or scroll up when lifting your finger. Looking at online forums, this seems to be a common problem with this particular phone from Samsung. Seems like they tried to cut some corners to get the price down while still advertising the 120hz display and it didn't work out well. Not sure if it's something that can be fixed with a software update but it wasn't corrected as of the October 2020 OTA update. Not going to chance waiting around for a fix and being outside the return window. If you are experiencing odd behavior with your screen and touch sensitivity, you're not alone. Bummer as well because otherwise I loved the phone.\n",

      "Review_Description: Now that the price on this phone has gone down to $600, it is a very good deal for the price.The Snapdragon 865 processor is more than fast enough for anything I want to do. 6GB of memory is less than some other phones in this price range, but it is still more than enough for most people.The phone feels very solid despite the plastic back. If you use any kind of case, you won't even notice the plastic back.The phone supports 25W fast charging, but for some reason they only included a 15W charger in the box. Buying the 25W charger separately is a waste of money as well as a waste of the natural resources that were used on the 15W charger. Amazon sells decent 25W fast chargers for less than $15, so cheaping out on the charger is a real lame move by Samsung. You can search Amazon for 15W chargers that support \"USB-C PPS\" mode and are UL Certified.The screen looks beautiful when you turn on the 120Hz mode. This does burn your battery more quickly, but the battery is big enough that it still lasts all day.The screen has been very responsive to me. I have read bug reports about screen glitches for some people. Samsung has already released bug fixes that hopefully have fixed this. I advise only buying this phone from an authorized dealer with no hassle returns so you don't have to worry about this bug.The phone does have a lot of Samsung bloatware. I owned a Samsung S-series phone several years ago and the bloatware was really bad then. This one is much better. You don't even need to create a Samsung account to use the phone now. Most of the Samsung bloatware (other than the camera app) won't work if you don't have a Samsung account, but if you never use it, this isn't a problem. There are several tutorials online about disabling all the bloatware if you never want to see any of it on your screen.The triple camera setup on this phone is very good for this price level. The telephone camera works great up to 3X in good light. Image quality deteriorates quickly if you zoom in past 3X or in lower lighting conditions. Telephoto cameras are getting rare in this smartphone price range, so I'm glad this phone has one. I really like using the telephoto lens for landscape and nature photography. The normal and wide angle cameras work better in lower light situations (including indoor situations), though not as good as the iphone or Google Pixel phones. Pictures do tend look more processed than with some other phone cameras. Some people like the Samsung look. Other people prefer more natural looking photos. You should try to look at sample photos before buying the phone, since you cannot completely disable the Samsung photo processing.This phone comes with Android version 10 out of the box, which is one version behind the Android version 11 that the Google Pixel phones are shipping with. Samsung promises software support with 3 version updates, but that is a little misleading since 1 of those version updates will be just to catch up with the current Android version 11. Still, 3 years of bug fixes and security patches is better than what Samsung used to offer.\n",

The front-facing camera has a little silver ring around it that makes it super noticable, and the phone seems to get pretty hot due to the plastic back, but otherwise I'm pretty impressed with this thing.\n",

      "Review_Description: **UPDATE 10/18/21**If you're thinking about the S21, stick with this phone. After a year of owning the S20FE, this phone is still great and performs perfect. I still love it.Last time I owned a Samsung phone was back in the TouchWiz days of the note 2. Since then for me it's been motorola and Google, but I decided to give Samsung a try again. I am so glad I went with this phone over the Pixel 5. At the time, the s20 FE was $100 cheaper than the pixel 5 and the reviews across youtube sold me on this phone. Having owned the G7 power and G power, having the extra battery life is important to me. At first I tried the A71 5G but it felt incomplete. I was not impressed with the build quality or the cameras, even the battery did not last despite being the same capacity as the s20 fe. I am so glad I returned the A71 5G and got this one just a few weeks later. I was not planning for samsung to announce this phone at all. Easily worth the extra $100. It feels more premium, and I prefer the matte finish on the S20 FE compared to the A71. The cloud white is so nice and universal, with hints of aura glow depending on the lighting. It has the finish to that of a CD. But as far as battery, out of the box with 48 percent I've been using the phone nonstop for a little over 2 hours now and I'm down to 27. That's pretty impressive considering the battery isn't fully calibrated. The One UI is great, the 120hz screen is super smooth and responsive and that SD 865 performance is very nice as well. The phone can keep up with me easily. Despite the lack of the headphone jack, I think the pros outweigh the cons. The screen, the build quality, the battery and the audio quality is very nice. 5G connectivity is fast with T-Mobile and the fact this phone supports wifi 6 capability, this phone is definitely future proof. This may be the start of something Samsung can move forward with. A premium device with flagship specs for less. I will definitely update the review as I have more time with the phone and upload some sample photos but as it is now, a solid 5 stars from me. You can't go wrong for $599.99. Flagship specs for a cheaper price, Samsung definitely got it right with the S20 FE. I can totally recommend. I'll definitely be sticking with this phone for a while, especially considering Samsung promised this phone 3 years of updates.*Update 1/21/2021*I've had the phone for a few months now and I just still love it as much as the first day I got it, the new One UI 3, android 11 update is definitely welcomed, the camera is still taking phenomenal pictures, and the battery is still holding up.  I was contemplating trading it in for the S21, but I think this phone is much better for what you get at the price it's offered.\n",

      "Review_Description: Just ordered my phone it came super quick at a discount from Amazon. For $635 , the phone is quick the cameras look really cool on the back but I'm not a fan of how clear they look the picture is fuzzy and is always halfway zoomed in. Coming from lg Google phone from 2017 the samsung ui and ecosystem is mediocre at best, it feels really slippery and unfufilling like every app you open is opened on accident like you just slipped into this app. Counter intuitive power off process(its not the same as to power on wtf ). Bixby sucks to say the least, a lot of wireless half baked features that are impractical. But the phone seems reliable enough, I know how to maximize battery life like first changing the wallpaper to a black and white version, limiting 5g/network(I like how you can easily enable 5g if needed, but who really needs that much power?), and of course keeping no apps running in the background, and putting the phone on do not disturb mode so it doesn't vibrate itself to oblivion, which is weird because the phone forces a lot of notifications even after you turn them off or minimize them. I expected a little cleaner software, honestly would have preferred a brand new s9+, but I couldn't find anything that wasn't refurbished. I turned the 120 Hz refresh rate off and boom the battery is lasting a couple days on the regular love 4500 MA battery. I like the glasstic back, but be warned there is a slippery feel to it so go to eBay and grab a quick 10 buck case to be safe. Overall I'm happy with the device. The expandable storage is very nice and I bought another 128 gigs for 30 bucks at target so I have all the memory I need and more! Just wish I could switch to the Google version of software but keep the Samsung hardware, because those pixels are looking weak! Watching the iphone 12 commercial made me shrug and grateful I had this phone, the price, the value, and the vibe of my mint cloud samsung 20 fe is one that is pretty much unmatched! The box is the phone and charger, the speakers sound is a little above average. The fingerprint reader is solid and practical. Totally worth it.\n",

      "Review_Description: Just received the S20 FE today.  Im switching over from the original Pixel XL. Wasnt thrilled enough with the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G lineup/availability. So I thought I would give this one a shot.  Overall its been a good first day with the phone.I popped in my Verizon sim card and after setup (see below) I immediately had cell service and 4G connectivity. No problems there.Setup was kinda a pain switching from a Google phone. I had my old phone backing up to Google drive. The setup process didnt quite help make a full transfer. It pulled in my contacts and app data, but didnt reinstall my play store apps automatically or transfer my SMS/call history. What I ended up doing was using the Samsung Smart Switch app. I installed it on my old/new device and it transferred every thing.  Contacts, SMS/call history, app data, photos, videos, etc. It even started automatically installing my missing apps. That was nice.Performance wise the phone feels pretty snappy and has a nice display.  I havent had a chance to play with the camera yet. Today was just 'get the phone up and running\" day.My biggest issue is not with the phone itself but with the the original listing on Amazon when I purchased the phone a few days back. It said the phone had 8GB of RAM.  That was a selling point for me.  When I booted up the phone I check the settings and it says 6GB. I came back into this phones listing in Amazon and wouldnt you know, now it says the phone has 6GB of RAM. Hmmm... That kinda ticked me off. But not the phones fault.\n",

So if you don't have Bluetooth headphones, you're out of luck, or will still need to go buy a pair.Customer service also did not help, the only solution is to return for a refund. I still need the phone so that's not a solution. All I wanted was for all the parts in the description to come.\n",

This will not be my last phone but it will be my LAST SAMSUNG!If you like to associate different ringtones to individual phone numbers like 'Freebird' to the ex's number, 'Show me the Money' to your Accountant, and some Barry White to the new significant other then DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!If you like to use a voicemail app that stores your phone messages on your phone so that you can in two swipes see and delete message and don't have to hit four buttons to call out to a 8** number just to hear/delete/save a message then DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!If you prefer to 'one swipe/delete' text messages from the Messaging App and do not want to be FORCED to use yet FOUR more screen touches to open the text/menu/delete/trash buttons just to delete a text message then DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!If you want to feel 100% assured that your are the first owner of this phone and the phone nor the packaging has been fiddled with where you have the 'Navy' version that the Manufacturer associated with the serial number on the phone instead of a 'Mint' cover to match the designation on a box label then DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!However,If you love touching your phone with extra unnecessary sub-menus then GET THIS PHONE!If you like your phone FULL of Google and Samsung Apps that you CANNOT remove OR Disable and that will constantly be up your, er in your face on a phone that you will pay high dollar for then GET THIS PHONE!If you want to save $100.00 from the Carriers for this model and save the extra $200.00 it would take to get a phone with real features then GET THIS PHONE!I 'Used' to look forward to using my phone and hearing the different tones associated with friends and family.  Thanks Samsung/Sprint for providing a substandard product with the release of the S20 FE 5G.\n",

      "Review_Description: What nobody anywhere is talking about and I wonder whyI wonder if I am more sensitive to this as I upgraded from a quite old Note 4 that I had rooted and was running mostly aftermarket apps on. But when I \"upgraded\" to this phone I was blown away by the staggering amount of bloatware and intrusive apps pre installed on this phone. The BIGGEST by far being Samsungs own software, it is everywhere! It has it's hands in everything and if you take the time to look through at all the permissions on this software it is staggering how much information about you it is allowed to collect.Now we all know that having a smartphone means some loss of privacy and that companies use the selling of certain information to offset the cost of the devices they are selling you. I understand that. But, again....maybe it's just me but I am not OK with the level at which they force this down your throat and the amount of preinstalled and (can not be removed or actually stopped) apps that have full permissions to ALL of your information.Yes it's a good phone, it should have a bit more ram for what it is, I like the SD card expansion slot ( I can't believe that has to be said) Snappy processor and camera is OK at best. I really expected more from what should have been Samsungs near flagship device for the time. Price seems to be going up again for some reason as well. When I bought mine in Febuary of 2021 it was 599 from Amazon themselves.\n",

      "Review_Description: If you play mobile games that require a lot of tapping and swiping from both fingers, stay away from this phone. The phone registers ghost taps during rapid finger movements between two fingers which creates a dragging effect. It's very noticeable in first person shooter games where your character will suddenly look at a different, unintended direction.It remains to be seen if this can be solved via software updates. Samsung already tried (i have the latest patch) and the problem still persists. If they can't patch it within my return period, it's going back.Other than that, yes you get flagship specs at a midrange phone price.\n",

      "Review_Description: I had my previous phone, a Huawei Mate 9  for 3 years (ordered from Amazon), and I felt it was time for an upgrade. After researching and narrowing my decision down to the Google Pixel 5 and the Samsung S20 FE 5G, I chose the S20 FE 5G. For me, it came down to being able to expand the memory and I prefer to have that option. So far, everything works great. I love the pastel color choices! Cloud lavender looks pretty and so does the Cloud Orange, but I had to go with my favorite color, Cloud Mint.The fingerprint reader is accurate and fast. When unlocking the phone, the bright light is a little blinding, especially if unlocking the phone in the dark. Face recognition works great and it unlocks well with my eyeglasses on too.For the battery life, it seems that it doesn't last long compared to my previous phone. With the S20 FE 5G, I noticed with my normal use (watching YouTube videos, using social media, surfing the internet, etc.), I would have to charge it after a day, but with the Mate 9, I was able to use it for almost 2 days before having to charge it.I love the quality of the rear/front camera. The rear camera focuses well and the photos appear brighter/sharper which I like. The front camera is fixed and doesn't allow for autofocus when tapping on the screen, which I'm bummed out about. I hope this is something that will be fixed. The super steady mode is awesome!Included in the box: phone, charging adapter, charging cable, paperwork, and the sim tray eject tool. I do wish the charging cable was a bit longer and I wish it came with earphones, but it's not a big deal. I'll be buying a usb-c to 3.5mm headphone adapter. I do have Bluetooth earbuds, but I prefer connecting directly for better sound.When I received my package and I opened it up, it came with ZERO packaging, which I was unhappy about. You would think it would come with some protection with bubble wrap or air pillows to avoid the phone from getting tossed around in the box. Amazon, please make sure the package is secured well so the product we are paying $$$ for arrives safely.\n",

I've already had to reprogram my fingerprints. The touchscreen doesn't always register. The program is full of bloatware. So much space is used by proprietary garbage apps that you can't delete. When I swipe down the alerts at the top there are advertisements! There aren't many settings on the keyboard. This whole interface is just annoying. I came from the Pixel 2 which was very easy to use, no bloatware. Just free and empty, lots of settings. I should have gone w/my gut and bought the Pixel 5.\n",

I thought the phone was defective and exchanged for another one. The second phone was not compatible with ATT 5G either. I only get LTE+, which is the faster version of 4G, but not 5G. However, it could be because ATT does not have a real 5G network yet.The phone is fine, although I am quite disappointed that it is not compatible with ATT 5G, which was one of the reasons why I decided to buy this phone.\n",

      "Review_Description: This phone is solid. It's interesting that in 2020, a \"budget\" phone is 700 dollars but it is definitely a great value for the money. The cameras aren't as great as the regular S20 line up but they are a solid upgrade coming from the S8. Just make sure you have great lighting if you plan to use the ultra wide lens or telephoto because photos get very grainy in less than  ideal conditions. Battery life is solid. I work all week and when I'm not on my phone a lot, I easily get 2 days and squeeze  in a few hours from the next day if I really can't get to another charger. If I have a day off and I'm on the phone for hours,  I can easily make it to the end of the day at 20+ percent.The screen is great. Colors are bright and the quality 120 Hz refresh rate screen is buttery smooth to navigate. The phone is definitely bigger and closer to the Note 20 (non Ultra model) in terms of size so that takes some getting used to. Touch could be a bit better. Sometimes you have to touch the screen more than once to activate the screen or to select something. The fingerprint reader is an optical one so it's hit or miss sometimes. I have found that  if I pay attention to where I place my finger, it tends to recognize it more easily.  I just never thought I'd miss the one on the S8 considering the poor placement of the thing.  The stereo speakers can get nice and loud and are better than the single firing ones found on my old phone. Reviewers say that the sound is not as rich as the more premium version of this phone bit if you're coming from a phone that is over 2 years old with only a single speaker, you' enjoy them.. Definitely  get a phone cover because the plastic back does scratch and dent easily if you drop it on asphalt as I'm finding out. Haptics are another area where Samsung cut back on this model. The vibration feels close to that of the S7 in a rickety sort of way. To their credit, they have calibrated the vibration motor to react more like when you are moving the cursor around on a text box like that found in a pixel. Just don't expect a solid thump like on the note 10 plus or the S20s. 6 Gb of ram is plenty now but I may wish I had gotten a phone with 8+ GB in a few years after some OS updates. Only time will tell. Its a crazy time and hard to believe that phone prices have inflated the way they have but if you can get the phone on sale, it's a no brainer and very easy to recommend.\n",

But it's a problematic phone.Firstly, build quality is inconsistent.  One was perfect, and two have gaps and overhangs of the back plastic onto the phone.  Second is battery life...for such a large battery, it doesn't feel like it lasts as long as it should.Most importantly...touch screen issues.  Just Google it.  All of ours have it, and it will drive you nuts.  The updates were supposed to help, and did to some extent, but the problem still persists and makes pinch zooming so annoying.  I wouldn't bother with this phone unless its heavily discounted.\n",

      "Review_Description: The Samsung has 20 at the 5G is the best value for the money.I upgraded from a Motorola G7 to this Samsung S20 5G unlocked.  My carrier is Verizon Wireless. All I had to do was install a new SIM card and this phone works beautifully. I am able to get 5G where available and it took me awhile to become familiar with Samsung apps but now I really like using Samsung apps instead of Google apps.But I'm amazed of how hard it is to learn a different ecosystem. I almost sent the phone back because I was under the impression that I needed the Google apps that I was used to using.Thankfully I hung in there and learned something new.Samsung makes great hardware and software. Samsung is going to give competition to the to the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft.Each phone company wants you to use their apps and it took me a month or two to get used to this because at first I thought they're forcing me to use their apps. I don't want bloatware, but as I became familiar with Samsung apps they work flawlessly with their products.The other thing  is the camera on this Samsung is outstanding and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Samsung has hooked me.The phone also works flawlessly with the Samsung Galaxy watches.Excellent customer service and support.\n",

      "Review_Description: i had the following questions:1. would it really be new out of the box?2. would it be functional given the mid price range ?3. would changing sim/switching from old phone work well?The answers:1. It was brand new in every way down to the box with factory seal.  Flawless condition2. Now keep in mind i switched from a much older galaxy S6. I dont care too much re the camera.  With these in mind, the phone works great and delivers all the performance you would expect.The ONE MAJOR thing to keep in mind: Even next to the old S6 (higher screen resolution), the screen looks a little shabby when set at the same brightness.  The contrast of dark letters is not so crisp/sharp as a higher resolution screen.  i adjusted to this by increasing the brightness.  But that means much less battery life.3. Changing Sim/converting the phone was very easy and 5G network registered immediatelyConclusion: You have to be ok with a less sharp, less bright screen, and mid range camera.  You can overcome the screen a little by increasing brightness but then battery life is less.If you are ok with these trade offs, this is a great phone and delivered brand new just as advertised.\n",

Maybe I'm late to the game, but wow. The difference between my old phone and this one are massive.- Good size, fits in my pockets (even most of my tiny girl jean pockets. Ladies, you know what I mean. Stupid small pockets.Cons:- the vibrate is terribly weak. I always keep my phone on vibrate but I can't with this phone. I can't feel or hear the vibration in my pocket or even when it's sitting on my desk right beside me. It's so bad.- the flashlight... my old phone would turn the flashlight on when you shook the phone a certain way. This one does not.  I have to unlock the phone and manually turn on the flashlight. Kind of a pain.Pro or con? The fingerprint sensor. At first, no matter what I did, it would not read my right thumb. At all. I had to remove it and redo it at least 3 times before it finally registered correctly. Now all my prints work just fine. You are only allowed 3 prints though and I would have loved 4. Oh well.Overall, I'm enjoying my new phone but there are several aspects that I miss from my old phone (like customizable keyboards).\n",

      "Review_Description: The phone works well as a phone, past the 5G switching not being completely worked out, but that is a carrier issue.  I am a Sprint customer and because of the merger and network confusion my phone thinks a 5/5 Sprint 4G LTE signal is  roaming and tried to grab the 1 bar TMobile signal..Now for the showstopper.  The touch hardware is complete and utter trash.  The October firmware update helped a bit.  The sensor array is in a horizontal/Vertical grid.  If you touch three points on the screen and slide any of those fingers past the same grid line as another finger, it drops the moving touch . 4 out of 10 times, and strobes like a series of taps the other 6. The strobing lasts for 1/10 second or so.  I used developer mode to show touches and can watch the touch just disappear.  Now if I place two fingers on each side of the screen so they're both on the same horizontal plane, and then move a third finger between them it drops touch and then strobes every single time.This really looks like an issue from the early days when companies were struggling to get multi finger gestures to reliably work.  Perhaps Samsung used a design made in 2006-2008 to maximize profits. Shameful.I pre-ordered this phone. I have never preordered any piece of hardware. I did it because \"Samsung knows howmto make a phone. That is one thing they get right, unless it explodes...\".  Well, apparently Samsung forgot how to make a touchscreen screen.... Yes, Samsung.  A screen.  That's your thing... You make screens. You screwed that up like a first time manufacturer.  And then you decided to sell it anyway. You even mentioned \"Games\" in your advertising.This is my third Galaxy S10 FE with this same issue.  Initial phone was Sprint branded (returned), second was unlocked (waited two weeks for more information and spent over an hour on the phone with Samsung, the Requested replacement), replacement phone has same exact issue.  Failing 3/3 of the time... That looks like 1... Yup.  100% failure rate. This is after the October firmware update that was supposed to fix the touch bugs.\n",

      "Review_Description: This phone was intended to be a considerable upgrade for me. It replaced a 5 year old Nexus 6p. I will not deny that many aspects of it are better. It is undeniably faster. The  modified version of Android, Samsung's One UI, does not impress. It feels like bloat and has made some features harder to find. The through display fingerprint reader feels about 50% as reliable as a rear reader. The area that reads is very small (as is the area on a back reader), but there is no physical surface feature to help you put your finger in the correct position. Most annoying to me is the lack of a headphone jack. I bought the phone knowing I'd give that up, but I assumed the only penalty of the usb-c to heaphone adapter would be the cost of purchasing one. The sound quality is far inferior through an adapter as compared to my previous phones with standard headphone jacks. Additionally using the adapter off of the power input port (usb-c) means your headphone cord comes out the bottom of the phone which is more annoying that I would have thought.\n",

      "Review_Description: This is a beautiful, capable, reasonable smartphone, but the particular one I received would not charge on my third-party wireless charger, either with or without the Samsung silicone case. I ordered a 15 W Samsung wireless charging stand, but that failed in the same manner, Attempts to get help from Samsung's support organization resulted in an erroneous conclusion that the 15W charger did not support the S20 series of phones, but the newer 9W version did, so I ordered the 9W charger...and got the same results. I concluded that the problem had to be with the QI system within the phone, and initiated a return procedure to Amazon, intending to request a simple 'return and replace with identical item', but that option was not available for the phone. Amazon indicated that to speed up the process, I should chat with their specialists before simply returning the phone for credit. After a one-hour 'chat' with Amazon technical help, who finally transferred me to Samsung technical help, who spent another hour before they concluded that I should take the phone to a Samsung-approved service center, which is 2.5 hours away, with no assurance that they could resolve the problem; even less probability they could resolve the problem in the same day...I processed the standard return-to-Amazon-for credit application. Then with a confirmation that the return was approved, I simply ordered another (identical) phone. On it's arrival, I quickly transferred all app, data, etc from the old phone to the new phone, swapped the SIM carrier (containing the SIM card and the external memory card). The new phone charges easily and quickly on both Samsung wireless chargers, even with the Samsung cover on the phone. Using the straight-forward Amazon process is simple and efficient, but when people get involved, the efficiency is subject to total loss, simplicity is gone, and patience becomes a victim.\n",

      "Review_Description: Got this phone (S20 FE) after i used my S9 for almost 3 years. I felt the upgrade after 2 weeks of use ( or even in an lesser time), the s20 fe is not a phone you can easily hold with one hand, the plastic back may seem cheap, but, it grows on you, also it won't break as easily like a glass back. The front camera doesn't disturb you when you are watching videos, movies, pic etc. Gaming, it will run very smoothly. Battery, if the phone starts at 100%, by the end of the day it won't be fully dead (even if you have the 120hz screen, which is like spreading butter on bread, you won't go back to 60hz after using the 120hz).Once you get to play with the phone itself, you will notice this cellphone can compete or even win its sisters like the s20 or the s20 plus (heck it can probably bit the iphone11 just with its extra perks)For the price you get, you won't get rip off. It's nice that you can this phone at an reasonable price and not spend 1k on a phone that can do the same thing.Highly recommend if you want a good Phone and for a great price!!!\n",

      "Review_Description: The SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G is my first true flagship phone I have ever bought.  I have been a Motorola user with my last being the Moto 5G Plus.  That lasted only 2 years and then moved so slow and functioned so poorly I knew I had to research and move into the big leagues.  I am so thrilled with every aspect of this phone.  Its screen is vibrant and colorful.  Its video quality is superb and scrolling around and going between apps it moves like lightning.  I am extremely impressed with the camera and video quality as well.  Some complain about the selfie camera.  At first I was not happy but did my research on how to use all its features and now I am beyond thrilled.  Everything here far surpasses all my expectations.  Phone call quality is excellent and the audio from the speakers also shines.  Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze and music and audio books sound excellent.  This is all enough for me to love this phone but add in the battery life and it becomes a true winner.  With excessive use I get at least a full day out of it.  I never got half a day with my Motorola.  I have installed a 128 gb sd card for quality amount of storage.  This phone never falters and performs at the highest level all the time.  Finally I have a true quality phone and I just love having it and using it.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Review_Description: I ended up returning this phone. It‚Äôs a really good phone but I just personally didn‚Äôt like how lightweight it felt and how large it was, or that the case was plastic. It‚Äôs a very beautiful color though. My biggest complaint is the camera quality. I am an artist and I just need my pictures to be perfect, I use the iPhone SE 2nd gen and in my opinion the camera on it is much better. The S20 FE camera is a bit lighter, a bit less saturated, and almost...grainy? I only notice when I zoom in on fine pencil lines etc. but I‚Äôve heard other reviews complaining of the same differences. Anyway, if you want a feather light, huge, very pretty phone with a pretty good but not perfect camera, this phone is okay. Just not worth $600 to me personally.\n",

      "Review_Description: Best of what the S20 has to offer in a cheaper build. When I say cheap, I mean lower cost and not necessarily bad quality. The plastic back is the best kind of plastic back you will get on a smartphone, definitely worth the price cut. It's actually better since you don't have to worry about it cracking if you drop it. Optical fingerprint scanner is a tad slower than what I'm used to, coming from the S8, but not slow and doesn't always unlock the first time. Battery life is what makes this phone great, lasts all day. I go to bed with about 35 to 45 percent left, go to sleep, wake up the battery has not drained and I charge it up in the morning before work. And with 120hz on all day. Fast screen is also another highlight, so much smoother than my S8. Cameras great, not a professional camera reviewer, go check out reviews on YouTube.\n",

      "Review_Description: I'm a diehard Android user coming from a Galaxy s7, and I wanted to treat myself to a brand new phone since I haven't been first owner of a phone since probably 2009. I spent months debating between Galaxy s10 or s20 series, but couldn't stomach spending almost a grand on a phone. When I saw this s20 FE was released with all the bells and whistles of the $1000 phone and for a more reasonable price, I had to go for it. The phone came undamaged, no scratches or smudges or anything. The battery life is great. I have a lot of screen time throughout the day, and by the time I go to bed at night I still have within the 70% range of battery left. The cameras are cool, but I haven't had a chance to really mess with the features all that much yet. I love that it works with my wireless charger. The display features are awesome. There are little things you can adjust to really make it your own customized phone. If you are debating on getting this phone, DO IT! It is totally worth the money and you won't be disappointed!\n",

      "Review_Description: After a couple of weeks I really like this phone.  It's fast and has a beautiful screen, big but not too big.  My S7 died so I had to upgrade, this was a major upgrade for me.  I will not buy a phone without an SD card slot so that eliminated the S21 and iPhone right off the bat.  My pictures are on the SD card and a backup of my call logs and SMS messages so I didn't really lose anything, the rest was backed up to my Google account.  I like that I can take photos and video in UHD at 21:9 aspect ratio so they fit my monitor.  Not bad for the price, I hope it lasts 4 years like my S7 did.  The S7 was the only one that ever died on me, I have my original Galaxy, an S3, S5, S7 (dead) and my Samsung flip phone still.  Now the S20 FE and I can definitely recommend it.\n",

      "Review_Description: The phone does work as a smart phone. When I can get it to take pictures in focus they are nice but it is hard to tell until after if I am not specifically looking at the focus.Auto focus:The auto focus is painfully slow. Sometimes it just works but most times it works after a solid 1-3 seconds. Sometimes it takes >5s which just leaves me wondering what it is doing that could take this long.A perfect example is with normal lens everything in view of the camera is >20' away and it is just stuck out of focus for 3 seconds. Then the focus finally starts to wander after another 1-2 seconds it focuses.This seems to affect both the normal and zoom lense. I don't use the wide angle much but I would guess it has the same problem.The final result of this is if I'm in a hurry and not paying attention to the focus 1/4 to 1/3 of my pictures are out of focusFinger Print Sensor:It works okay most of the time. When in a dark environment it is blindingly bright if you don't cover the entire sensor before the back light turns on at ~100% brightness.Also sometimes the phone unlocks at 100% brightness too which just seems like sloppy programming that doesn't turn down the rest of the screen brightness before it displays it. It seems like it realizes it is dark after the phone has been unlocked for a 1/10 of a second.Overall it makes unlocking my phone in the dark painful at best. It feels like it is wrong more times than it is right so I close my eyes before I try unlocking it.Using the Camera kills other apps:I run and keep track of it on my phone. If I take some pictures while running more often than not the camera app will silently kill all apps running on the phone. So when I get done I find that my phone stopped recording when I took some pictures. There doesn't seem to be a way to stop the camera from killing everything. In testing I can get runs that are 39 seconds long by taking pictures shortly after starting the run.Note: Moved to this phone from the S9\n",

This is exactly why I refuse to buy Hard drives from these people.I bought an 2 extremely expensive FPGA dev boards just to have 1 that I was required to sign for but the other one was where the Amazon box was placed inside a USPS box then sent through regular mail.GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER PEOPLE.There is no reason to connect your Alexa to a dish washer where you focus your energy yet you can't even send high end electronics through the mail without controversy.I have no doubt this review will make it through but hopefully someone will read it and say...hey...Maybe we should look at this.\n",

      "Review_Description: I've been a Samsung fan and user for a long time and I looked forward to finally upgrading from the galaxy s8 active. I did tons of research and finally chose this galaxy s20fe and dropped the $600 to buy it with excitement.Now that I have it, I'm sad to say that the camera - one of the single most important features of the phone for me - is broken and/or unusable. No trauma, no visible damage, but the lens rattles around if you shake the phone a bit and all of my pictures in the 1x to 3x zoom level come out like the one you see here.The camera has 3 lenses for different zoom levels and only the 1x - 3x zoom range is useless, but that's the most important one.I think Samsung needs to work on the 3 lens design some more as all of their multi-lens phone cameras seen to have problems.Anyway, I'll be attempting to trade this phone back to Samsung toward a galaxy s9 (shame to have to revert to older models for reliability) or some other single-lens camera or selling it as is and buying an iPhone. Haven't decided yet.\n",

      "Review_Description: I have tried a lot for phones recently. Sony, pixel 5, and s21 ultra.Pixel 5 freezes randomly at times and Bluetooth issues, Sony was just not very good and drained battery life like crazy. I tried giving the Sony two chances because the camera features are nice but it wasn't enough enough to cover the flaws. The s21 ultra was fantastic, but I couldn't justify the price tag. This phone however was the best. 120hz screen makes it feel premium, but hardware is not slow to where to muddied the user experience. The screen is bright, and it's not 4k but you can't tell on a all device. The battery life also lasts so long because the resolution is not high. Samsung's interface is quite nice and it certainly makes using an android phone extremely enjoyable because it doesn't feel cheap like the Sony did. I will never use an iPhone again, and it was hard for me to find a great alternative. I was hesitant on getting a Samsung too because I was in love with Google products up until the pixel 5. However I can say I'm a big fan of Samsung and their phones and will probably keep using their phones given the user experience was unrivaled by any other Android phone. I would highly recommend this phone\n",

      "Review_Description: Im upgrading from a Note 8 to this so needless to say its a very welcome upgrade overall except for a few things. Battery life is much better considering how old my Note 8 is. Screen is a downgrade as its only 1080 over my 1440 but still great for what it is. The fingerprint reader is a double edged sword for me. Coming from a note 8, the position of the reader is an upgrade (the reader on the note is on the rear of the phone) but its reliability is iffy. Sometimes itll recognize immediately and other times it takes it a while to recognize it. This is a common issue documented elsewhere as well but not a deal breaker. The biggest issue for me is the camera. While the camera is better than the note 8s on paper, in the real world im having issues with it. The focus is terrible, especially while using flash. The camera consistently gets confused as to where it needs to focus and flash pictures are completely unuseable. Overall a great phone but decide if what I described is a deal breaker for you\n",

      "Review_Description: I was worried based on some reviews this was difficult to activate.  I did it within 45 minutes of unpacking the device.  I transferred using Smart Switch app, watched YouTube video on how to move sim card from my old phone to my new phone and the new phone works great.  No Verizon calls, no Verizon store.  This was my first cell phone purchase not made directly with Verizon.  I had worries but Amazon has a return policy that made decision easier knowing that was an option if I couldn't figure it out.  No new contract with Verizon is a BIG bonus!\n",

I do not use a lot of data because I mostly us my phone for routine things like calls, texts, GPS, information on interesting topics.  I'm not a game player and this phone provides me with all the capabilities I need at a reasonable price.\n",

      "Review_Description: I was so excited to get my Galaxy S20 FE phone as it was an upgrade from the S8 I've had for years.  I purchased the US version Unlocked and took it to my local US Cellular store to have a clerk switch everything from my S8 to the S20.  I was told by the clerk after she attempted to get the phone registered and set up with US Cellular that the phone was not compatible with the network.  According to the Amazon add this phone is supposed to be compatible with US Cellular so I do not know if I was getting a line of BS from the US Cellular clerk because I didn't purchase the phone through them (even though they no longer carry the S20 FE) or if it's false advertisement on Amazon (hence the 2 star rating).  I was so livid yesterday after leaving the US Cellular store that I just went home, started the return process to send this phone back to Amazon, boxed it up and dropped it off at the local UPS Store.  If I want to upgrade my phone I guess I'm stuck with purchasing a phone through US Cellular so I know it will work.  I'm looking at the Galaxy A52 as it's similar in price to the Cloud Navy S20FE that I purchased through Amazon.  I refuse to pay $1,000+ for an S series phone.üò†\n",

      "Review_Description: I've had this phone 11 days and it was supposed to be an upgrade for me from a cheaper brand of smartphones. The cheaper brand was good, but didn't last long. Now I miss those cheap ones.My new 20 FE 5G sometimes won't read my fingerprint. Annoying, but I just enter my pin.However, last night I tried and failed - over and over - to copy and paste something. It appeared to copy, but kept pasting the previous text I'd copied.I don't have a lot of money and this was a stretch for me. Now I'm stuck with a crappy phone.EDIT I've now had this phone 3-3¬Ω months and, without exaggeration, I can say I hate it.An alarm began ringing today and it only stopped when I turned off the phone.Calls come in and I only know I've gotten them when I find a voicemail or look at Recent Calls.To paraphrase a friend - You know how 'phone' is spelled? It starts with an 'F.'\n",

      "Review_Description: After owning this phone for 2 months I'm back being a Samsung fan. My last was the S4 and the 2014 note 10.4, I felt abandoned when Samsung didn't update. Just updated to Android 11 and I commend Samsung for keeping their word on supporting this phone.Battery life is good with heavy usage over 24 to 36 hour period. Usually have 15% when I plug in the charger. The finger print reader has a quick response if you find the EXACT spot on the screen. Screen is rich with color and response, but you'll need to adjust sensitivity if you use a screen protector. The phone has to many features to go over here, I will say that I'm only about 40% into discovery of moderate research of all the settings. If you have a smart things hub you'll love the user experience with the app. My Galaxy Buds+ and Active 2 watch also have a great interface and user experience.\n",

      "Review_Description: Just recently purchase the Galaxy S20 FE 5G (1-2021) what a great phone, smart with many features and compact enough to keep in your pocket ( I had bought the Ultra model and it was to bulky to keep in your pocket) the battery life is great and it charges quickly with the charger that comes with the phone ( I read the S21 doesn't have a charger with the package) the camera is great, I'm a hobby photographer and use Olympus mirrorless camera and this phone comes very close to the same quality pics, another good feature is that is made in South Korea, some parts maybe made in China, but I want to stop buying Chinese products when I have a choice. The phone is beautiful well designed, is a small computer it connects to my PC and when I'm working I can receive and send messages from the PC., never mind the iPhone, this Samsung is great, if you have a choice buy it you will not regret it.\n",

      "Review_Description: Should have believed the other reviewers who hated the overly sensitive touch screen.  Even with the \"block accidental touches\" option turned on, it is twitchy and very unpleasant.The phone does stream phone calls and music to my hearing aid via Bluetooth, which was what I bought it for, so I'm going to keep it - but I hate it and may store it in a foam-rubber-lined steel box to keep it from unlocking and starting some unwanted app.The typical Samsung bloatware is present and can't be deleted or disabled by someone as un-tech-savvy as me.  Same for the google pestware.  But I knew that from the git-go so can't complain.Still, listening to music is a blessing!  My hearing is such that even with a great stereo and speakers, it sounds like shit.  But played by the phone through Bluetooth to my hearing aid it sounds pretty good - and that's the best I'll ever get.\n",

      "Review_Description: Ive been a Crapple guy since the Moto Razor....but Im so tired of their proprietary BS with MY Music That I PAID for. I am phasing them out, replaced my iPad and my third iPhone like the other two were acting sketchy ( blue screen of death and the jitters on the X) and when this laptop is soon to get replaced as well) Apple nows how to present their goods, kinda like Tiffany but w/o the diamond. Anyway while the packaging is as nice the S20 fe is Amazing. Easy to learn, fantastic camera and switching all my contacts, calendars  and numbers took seconds without a cable! the best part at least to me was the pleasant surprise of finding that when I changed over my sims card that I could also install a hell of a lot of memory behind the sims card (I installed a gig card as that was all I had kicking around for my digital camera) and you can have your files and photo saved directly to it! Brilliant! I have to say that 90% of the apps I had on the X I down loaded through the google and Samsung apps stores so I now have two stores vice one which is nice and both verify the apps are virus free. It is also 5G which will be nice when I get it in this area and I also understand that this phone is good for overseas travel on vacations or business. The apps that come with this phone are intuitive unlike Crapple which I never mastered. This isn't simple by any means but it is much easier to learn once you down load the book from the web. Bottom Line? Wish I listened to my friends instead of being a snob and bought a Sammy earlier! And at almost Half the coast!!!\n",

AMOLED screen is just BEAUTIFUL! Gorrilla Galss 3 is a must... battery life is great, I'm on it a lot and still 40-50% by end of day... supplied charger is plenty fast enough... menu is bloated and complicated, but manageable... LOVE the stereo speakers! Just an all around great experience... no need to get the S20. Great price here... sold by and shipped by Amazon, what more do you want??\n",

      "Review_Description: Edit: I'm a super heavy user.  I'm at about the 6 month, and now the device gets warm when it's taxed or the weather is a little warm.  And the battery life, whuch is still great, and dropped down significantly.  Love the phone.  Very concerned about the longevity. Particularly as i come up on summer in floridamark Edit:  one month in, and I love it!  Battery lasts all day, and I'm on my phone nonstop.I'm used to the change in buttons and actually like them.  Put in settings so power options do come up now. Like the screenshot method, mostly.Got a supcase military grade unicorn beetle case so it's well protected.  Signal is great on tmobile.  5g is slower than 4g, so I turn it off.  but I'm out in the middle of nowhere.Touch screen works perfectly even under double acreen protectors!  Updates get sent all the time.  So worth it!And my mom is blown away by the telephoto lens.  For me it's a fun binoculars, but pretty mushy picture quality at telephoto distance.  S9 couldn't do that at all. The close up distance/focus is much better than my s9.  The rest is pretty similar.---It's only been a couple days but so far so good. None of the touch screen or overheating issues a few people listed on the internet.I took very good care of my S9, but it was overheating often. This is night and day difference.I thought the volume buttons above the power button would take some getting used to, but actually the only downside is taking a screenshot is more difficult. Oh, and the power button no longer turns it off! Although I've read There are some workarounds for that. Otherwise you have to go up in the menu.I love that it's the same width as my old phone, but taller. Gives me more space but I can still hold it.I absolutely hate that there are no good colorful heavy duty cases out for it yet. Come on OtterBox!I wanted to go with the S10 because I was nervous reading reviews, and how new this was. But this was cheaper, and so far I'm very happy with my choice.Please note, red it definitely an orangey red.  I went with red so it would be more visible if all I could find for now was transparent cases. But if I could go back I would definitely choose purple again.I've also read a lot of people turn the 5G off because it's not available everywhere and you don't really want it constantly switching between 4G and 5G. 5G was coming in pretty good for me out in the boonies with T-Mobile. I did switch it to 4G yesterday and that also worked fine during a trip.Transferring information using Smart Switch actually worked really well for me. My S9 main Drive was completely full.  The SD card was half full. This brought over ALMOST everything perfectly, and it wasn't even very slow.  The only things it didn't bring over were  paid apps that I had installed with a different Google account. I had to add the rest of my Google accounts and do those by hand. Not sure if that would have been any different had I installed all the Google accounts first.I would say it's very slightly brighter than my S9. I don't have a problem with the camera being on the screen.Haven't had great luck with a fingerprint yet, but I do need to redo it since I put a screen protector on anyways.Happy happy!\n",

It doesn't always stay connected to the WiFi in standby mode, it will just give me a blank screen sometimes and need to be restarted, and MMS sometimes won't go through without restarting the phone.  These are the issues I've had in the first month.  I've also even killed the battery a few days.  I had decided to return it, but just missed the cut off.

I have had Samsung phones exclusively since about 2013 when I bought the Note 3 and thought for sure I would never buy from another manufacturer. At first I was pleased with the phone. Then about 6 weeks after purchase I got out of a movie to find my phone screen had cracked inside my pocket, nothing else was in there at the time. The screen is made of inferior materials to the ones in the flagship phones. I called Samsung customer support, after much back and forth managed to get a refund for the price I paid for the phone. I have a Pixel now and would never go back to Samsung. This phone is poorly designed and breaks easily.\n",

      "Review_Description: I've been using touchscreen phones about as long as anyone else. Many years. This screen is a little weird. Sometimes it won't track my finger completely, when I'm scrolling text. It's really disconcerting.The fingerprint reader doesn't work as well as older Samsung phones where it was on the back of the phone. Those worked almost always... maybe once every couple days it would need a second read.This one, probably 10-20 times per day it won't read my fingerprint right, and I have to do it a second, third, or fourth time. Occasionally it will even refuse to read so many times in a row I have to draw my pattern to unlock.Final problem: when I'm taking pictures with it, sometimes the camera app will \"freeze\" for 10-15 seconds at a time. It will seem like it's working, but just won't take a picture, no matter how many times I jam that take-a-picture button on the screen. Really annoying to lose 15 seconds of shots because the camera app sucks.One time it stayed \"frozen\" so long that the \"camera app has stopped responding\" thing popped up.\n",

      "Review_Description: This SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G was not my first choice, but since LG has stopped manufacturing phones, it was my second choice.  Replacing my LG Style 6, which measures over 7\", this Samsung phone is smaller but still comfortable to use in most regards.  Most phones I and my wife have had these past several years have their fingerprint reader on the back of the phone, which is much easier to use and more comfortable.  The Samsung S20 FE has a fingerprint reader embedded on the bottom of the screen, which is a bit awkward to use.  But the fingerprint reader is fairly accurate providing you follow the directions and scan multiple areas of your fingertip.  The screen is vibrant with deep colors & good contrast.  Since my phone is primarly a phone that I occasionally use for texting, I haven't used the camera yet nor do I use all of the features associated with video.  I have my dozen or so apps that I use frequently, and they all work well on this phone.  There isn't much bloatware installed by Samsung; most of it is installed by Google.  I do seem to get a bit better connection with this phone.Setup was a breeze.  I use ConsumerCellular as my carrier, and all I had to do was move my SIM and microSD cards from the old phone to this new phone, and everything was automated after that!  I used the SmartSwitch app to transfer from the LG phone to the Samsung phone, and that went smoothly, easily and without issue.\n",

      "Review_Description: Ok so I switched to this phone from a Google Pixel 3a. I set it up June 30th a day after I got it. The first problem was that my incoming messages from several people were time stamped as three hours before I received them when the reality was that we were having a real time conversation. This is still a problem but today I have encountered another  issue wherein the phone will not stop rebooting. It still does it in safe mode and the battery charger trick didn't do it either. Which means I will have to do another factory reset on this phone. The only reason this review has more than one star is because I used to be a Samsung stan before I got the pixel. If the factory reset doesn't work or if i can't do it before the phone reboots I am going to try and return it, this isn't ok.*Update: I did the factory reset and it didn't work. We are downto one star because this is not something I am ok with.\n",

This was quickly baked and released to the market to make $$$$. No accountability Samsung! None! Please release a fix immediately or offer to exchange these clunkers that are less than 3 months old! Before you buy just google Warning Camera Failed....100's of new owners posted the issue. I also posted on Samsung's community web site.

I've owned several Galaxy phones in the past and have always been satisfied. This phone does it all. Good battery, good screen, good camera, fast charging, 4k video, good audio, good looks, multiple colors, SD card support, wireless charging, wireless power sharing, facial unlock, etc. I have never had any issues with this phone. This is by far my favorite phone ever. If I lost it today I would buy it again without hesitation. I did a lot of research before getting this, and when it was announced, I knew it would be the perfect phone for me. If you're considering this phone, please look up \"MKBHD S20FE\" on YouTube. He highlights a lot of things about this phone and they also gave it the phone of the year award. You cannot beat this value for what you're getting. I love it!\n",

Really annoyed and I've been a Samsung user forever. I haven't even dropped the phone yet and it's doing this. Very bad quality. Going to try to return it. I'm assuming this thing is defective.

      "Review_Description: I purchased this phone a year ago. The camera on this phone is really great. Clear, sharp pictures. I do like the features of the phone. After having the phone for 6 months the middle of the phone became a dead spot. Every time I would tap on it nothing would happen. Now, the phone has been freezing up or closing the window I have open. There have been several updates lately. After the last two, my Galaxy watch will disconnect from my phone when I walk to another room. Very frustrating. I'm seriously considering getting a new phone. I love Galaxy phones. This is my third one. But, the issues with this phone are things that shouldn't be happening for another 2 years.\n",

      "Review_Description: Upgraded from an S9+ and while I was admittedly missing my old phone at first, the S20 FE has quickly won me over. The fingerprint reader works great, the screen is nice. I love the 120hz refreshrate. The camera is excellent with more features and capabilities than I know what to do with. The phone is slim; I put a thin case and some cheap screen protectors on the front and camera and it still feels nice. It is wider than the S9+, so that took some getting used to. The phone is quick and responsive and I have never felt that I am wanting for processing power or RAM. If you use your phone for basic things, this will suit you just fine.\n",

This is unquestionably the worse company to deal with. Sent it back and they sent me the same thing back. What? They want me to pay additionally for a cord and plug? Now that is laughable. I bought my son a $200.00 phone and his came with everything including earplugs for goodness sake. Oh and this phone is way, way too sensitive to touch.  Try to google something and whatever you start typing it automatically shows everything starting with that letter or number!!! That is extremely frustrating.  All I have to do is breathe and it does something totally unrelated to what I want to do. I'm still contemplating sending this cell phone back.\n",

      "Review_Description: I purchased this for my parents to replace the old Galaxy S9+. Unfortunately I will have to return it because it seems to be either defective or too cheaply made with too many corners cut. First of all, the haptic feedback and vibration in general is very weak and doesn't feel as punchy as on S9+. Second of all, the display has worse color uniformity, you can notice the differently colored display areas at all angles. Last but most important - the automatic brightness is either buggy or completely broken, the phone decreases the brightness every time I lock it and when I unlock it - it does not increase the brightness to previous value (even in same room lighting) and keeps display very dim unless I am in a very bright room. This phone is not worth its current price for me with all the issues I have seen.\n",

      "Review_Description: Overall, I like the phone.  It's fast, stable, and feature packed.  I replaced an older LG G8 and this is my first Samsung phone since the original Galaxy (which I was horrible for me).  I bought this because it supports an SD Card and was otherwise a relatively inexpensive, yet full featured phone.If I have one notable complaint, it's how the camera physically protrudes from the phone.  Not much, but it prevents it from sitting flat on a surface (unless I have it in a case).  This might be necessary for the camera's features and the \"thinness\" of the phone, but it makes me concerned about scratching the camera glass.  While there are glass screen protectors for the camera glass, they don't stay on well unless appropriately protected in a case.Overall very good, but I don't like how the phone makes me concerned about damaging the camera area and doesn't otherwise sit flat outside of a case.\n",

I put a glass screen protector on it as soon as I got it and a gel type case. I will say though, the glass screen protector does affect fingerprint recognition somewhat. Out of the box, the fingerprint sensor works great, but with the screen protector, it misreads the fingerprint maybe 1/5 of the time. But that‚Äôs not a limitation on the phone, just the screen protector. Otherwise I‚Äôm very happy. Display is beautiful and battery life is amazing!\n",

And it's got a lot of functionality with pip and other features.Next up is signal.  I live in a rural area so service is tricky,  but this beast finds signal in all but the most taxing of conditions,  inside a manufacturing plant for example.Camera is on the list too,  don't worry here we are. Overall it's a good camera.  It's not the best camera out the,  but it does a very fine job of trying to be the best. Many filters and functions await you here.The battery is impressive.  I'm kinda hard on my phone battery,  and this one could take the abuse. Fairly quick charging off a wall jack or portable battery with plenty of active use time.  You get more features here too with power sharing and highly tunable battery saving options.All in all,  I'm very satisfied with the phone and I'm sure many others feel the same.P.S.  That Snapdragon is a monster.\n",

      "Review_Description: I have not had this phone for long; maybe a few months in with this device. The battery life is impeccable for me! I am a young person. That being said, I am on my phone very often. I have watched hours of movies, YouTube videos, and shows. I am not much of a tech nerd but I can say that compared to my old phone the battery lasts more than all day, after countless hours using it.I originally bought this type of phone because I hoped that it would not be obsolete in two years like my old LG K10. I also bought this phone for it's DeX feature. You can basically turn your phone into a computer desktop if you have a projector or desktop computer/laptop using an HDMI cord to type-C. This is an awesome device! The screen is very colorful and watching videos on it is perfect!I must say that this phones fingerprint reader is horrendous. It has only read my fingerprint about 62% of the time. I really do not care about it, because my old phone never even had that feature. I have not tried the face recognition feature yet.Something that I do not like is the back camera sticks out from the phone a little. I would recommend you get a phone case right away, or at least get camera and screen protectors ASAP. If you drop your phone one good time without a case and protectors, your whole phone would probably malfunction. The cameras I think would shatter internally.\n",

      "Review_Description: I was so excited to finally get a decent phone and I was looking into this one because I really care about the camera quality. According to my husband this was good phone. I went ahead and bought it. It's been a while since I've paid a lot for a cell phone because all I needed it for mainly was for calling/ texting/ pictures. Since my old phone doesn't take good pictures I asked my husband for a camera or a better cell phone that took good pictures. Everything went fine until I wasn't able to download or accept group messages or pictures. Also, I usually listen to music on my way home from work and Pandora didn't work at all. It kept skipping the music and at times it would work, but other times it wouldn't. I spoke to a Amazon Tech, I went online on google to look for ways to try and fix these issues. I restarted the phone, clear the data, the cache. I tried everything I could and it wasn't working. I returned it because I want a phone that actually works. It might just be a defective phone, but not satisfied especially since I had bought all the protection for this phone ahead of time.\n",

The rear camera lense stick way out of the phone requiring you to buy a separate protector for the back. When a slim phone case is on its nearly flush with the rear lense/glass.There are a lot less options for cases, went with same brand of case and they didn't even give it a back stand either.This phone is one worth skipping over, definitely not worth more than $250...\n",

After using an iphone 5s for many years, wanted a 5G phone with wiresless charging, expandable memory, fast processor, more ram and at least a 4500 mah battery to last a few days. Also got a notice that At&t was ending their 3G network in February so it was time. The mint green was out of stock from Amazon but luckily I found one from this seller in used but brand new condition with at 90 day seller and Amazon warranty. Expected it to take a few weeks to get here but got it 2 days later. It came in the original packaging with all the accessories. Plastic wrap still on the back and sides of phone. Works great so far. Would buy from this seller again. Checked with Samsung Support and was informed that there was still a manufacturer warrany on it. So far so good. Just relieved to have a phone that works fast and last all day.\n",

      "Review_Description: I've had this phone for a few months now and I'm definitely happy with its overall performance and ability to power through what I ask it to. The camera is decent enough and it behaves like flagship without the price. It certainly outperforms my Samsung a71 which simply gave up on life after a year. That being said, the biggest issue I have with this phone is that battery just seems to lose percentage at an alarming rate for a new phone. I don't know if it's the battery chemistry or the systems taxing the phones systems but, the battery on this phone drains on par with my s10+ after I had it for a year. The thing I always demand out of my phones is a strong battery and this one is middling for something fresh out of the box.Oh and, the 5g hasn't blown me away either... I can't tell the difference between 4g and 5g, but that could be my provider and not the phone.In short, decent phone, good specs, battery makes this phone not perfect.\n",

      "Review_Description: I honestly haven't had any problems with this phone and I've had it for over a month now. Honestly I think it's a perfect mid-range phone since I wasn't willing to pay flagship prices for the higher end s20's. This phone is fast and the 120hz makes scrolling flawless. The camera, while not the best on the market, still takes amazing pictures unless you zoom in too much. The battery life lasts way longer than my old phone, I usually don't have to charge until I go to bed. Of course if you're using it all day then the battery will drain quicker, otherwise yes it does last all day. Also I have MetroPCS and had no problems switching to this phone or connecting to the 5G network. Overall, if you looking for a decent but cheaper upgrade then this is the prefect phone!\n",

      "Review_Description: This phone is absolutely gorgeous in color, sleek, and has such amazing battery life. I do have to say, I chose the 20 FE specifically for the color and because it has better camera specs than the other phones in the 20 line. I love how fast it is, how well it connects to Bluetooth, the color on the screen, the camera features (both front and rear) and so much more. It is pretty durable too. I've dropped it without a single scratch or crack. The thing that I probably miss the most about my S9 is the curved edge as this phone is flat but it's obviously not a deal-breaker for me. I do also have pretty small hands so one-handed use is a little bit difficult even with a ring on the back of my case. Overall, I am very happy with this phone!\n",

Samsung makes the back out of metal instead of glass now, so that's a plus. The color red you see in the images is not the muted red you get in person. It actually looks kind of a metallic and immensely better!!!! There is not a tool in the box to open the sd drawer, it was fortunate we had one from a previous phone so we could activate it and insert the memory card. The charging cable is short, a longer one would be nice. I also like how Samsung did away with the curved edges on the screen.\n",

The Samsung S20 series are best of breed, whatever you will use it for, it is versatile, flexible, and there is an 'ap' for it that will do whatever you want any cell to do!  It is sized to fit my hand, I think that it will fit your hand too.

After 4.5 hours in several stores, I was unable to get this unlocked phone to connect to the Sprint Network, and had to get my account transferred to T Mobile. Butt they're the same company now, aren't they? My wasted weekend says no. If you're a Sprint user, you can get it to work on T Mobile, eventually, so expect some frustration.That said, battery life is awesome so far. I did change the refresh to 60 HZ from 120 HZ to help it last longer. Fingerprint reader has been flawless for me. Camera is awesome. Android transfer program moved most of my stuff over, although I did have to manually reload about half of my apps. In general, I love this phone.\n",

The fingerprint sensor is absolutely terrible. It fails about half of the time. No matter how good the phone is you will hate it if it rejects you every other time you try to use it. Also if you are looking at the screen in sunlight it will get very dim after a few minutes to the point that it is not usable. I think this is to prevent overheating but I have never seen any other phone do that. Overall this phone is okay but I don't love it.\n",

      "Review_Description: Compr√© este tel√©fono para poder jugar Call of Duty Mobile. Estuve tentado a comprar otro terminal, dise√±ado espec√≠ficamente para ese fin. Pero al final me decid√≠ por el Samsung por su estilo que es bastante m√°s refinado y porque, en papel, sus caracter√≠sticas eran similares. Un buen chip y una buena pantalla con alta taza de refresco. Lamentablemente el tel√©fono ha tenido algunas fallas. Al principio era software. Problemas con Google Play, con discord y ahora con la lectura de la sim card. Debo reiniciar el tel√©fono para que los servicios de llamadas, mensajer√≠a e Internet funcionen. Es una l√°stima. Adem√°s el software de reconocimiento facial y lectura de huella en pantalla es realmente malo.Por √∫ltimo, la conectividad con accesorios de marcas distintas a Samsung es bastante malo. Tengo una wristband de Xiaomi y la conexi√≥n entre el tel√©fono y la banda y inestable. Debo estar abriendo la aplicaci√≥n de mifit para que realice la descarga de informaci√≥n constantemente.\n",

      "Review_Description: Total piece of crap waste of money. Half the time I can't hear people on the phone. It freezes, touch screen doesn't work properly. It's as if this phone was released way too soon before it was ready. It was a pretty inexpensive galaxy tho so I thought why not. Now, I know why not. BTW the camera on S8 has better looking photos.My husband is watching my struggles with this phone and he's using it as an opportunity to say \"see, I told you you should've gone with an iphone\". As an android loyalist, this is extremely disappointing and infuriating.\n",

At $499 it's a bargain at the price point simply because of the Oct 2020 release date.One issue for me is I use it for personal and work. I think this causes a Play Store App install issue (not sure if it's Android or Samsung bug). At first it seems unfixable. But in my case removing the Sim card and SD card ND then a reboot fixed it.\n",

      "Review_Description: Not sure why there are so many 5 star reviews, when there should be 4's. Why? In June 2021, the sellers posted 8 GB of Ram and the phone only had 6 GB. That's false advertisement. Apparently they change their description off and on.I lose power quicker than I imagined I would.  My friend has a Samsung 9 and his power last longer than mine, go figure.It's not a bad phone. Yet, sometimes I do wonder if it was refurbished and not new. Some little odd things here and there.\n",

      "Review_Description: Bought this phone because my pixel 3 microphone died after two years and I wanted higher quality hardware. This phone has that. Camera is very good (though colors are sometimes a little off compared to Pixel). Microphone is clear, speaker volume is much louder, things load fast, it's waterproof,, etc etc. But the Samsung version of Android is extremely annoying to use. My typing is slower than ever, I often must repeat touch inputs multiple times. Fingerprint reader works fine though your fingertip must be at just the right angle, flat to the screen. Auto brightness adjust is awful and when unlocking the phone in a dark room it will flash super bright in your face before correcting. Phone is just large enough that one-handing is difficult, which causes me to tap things I didn't want to and drop it more. Overall, it works fine, or even very well, but it's simply unpleasant to use. I guess they've got to find some way to remind you that you didn't spring for the ultra expensive flagship phone.\n",

I like the bigger screen and image quality is super nice, even compare to other 2020 phones. Sound is clear, even at maximum volume.What I wish it had:Expandable memory slotI know other versions have it, this one doesn't. Storage is 128gb, which is plenty since I usually don't keep important files in my phone. Encrypted files in the cloud üòäAs far as 5G is concerned, it works well but there at times is really slow, so it's off for now.In summary, I am very happy with this phone.\n",

Other than the screen scratches the phone is pretty much out of the retail box. Definitely legitimate samsung product for a lot less. The phone itself runs very smooth and was indeed factory unlocked, the in screen optical fingerprint reader is pretty fast and accurate, the face recognition uses the phones 32mp front camera and could use some work, but is still fairly reliable.

There are a few features I will have to get used to, but I can adapt. The only downside so far is only having 3 fingerprints to use to unlock your phone, but that's minor. I definitely recommend.

When using it I immediately noticed how fast and smooth it was from switching between apps and playing games and scrolling on Insta. I absolutely love it. I'm glad Samsung ditched the glass backs and went back to something more solid. It has a good size screen and nice weight to it. I added a Spigen case and screen protector.\n",

      "Review_Description: I like the phone overall. it is pretty speedy and the battery life is very good. I am not a camera connoisseur so I can't comment on whether the camera is all that it's supposed to be but it seems good. I will say that both the fingerprint reader and the face recognition our spotty at best. I often need to use my unlock code but that is easy. I've only had it a couple of months but so far so good. I am not sure that it is worth the extra money over a phone that's about half the price for someone who doesn't really use the camera.\n",

      "Review_Description: I switched from the Samsung A12 to this. I was sent one of these phones and realized quickly that the battery life was not good. My old phone had a better battery. So I sent it back and got another sent. This seems to have slightly better battery but wont last me all day. I can get through probably 8 or 9 hours of on and off use on this phone before having to charge. Considering I got it on sale I would say the $100 dollar savings compensates for this but still a little upset.\n",

In practice, this is a 200$ xiaomi phone with worse cameras and batteries.In performance and network features this thing is great. The ram and processor are great, so why did you slap these inferior 12mp grainy cameras on! Ya'll even put in an SD card slot!Good lord this could have been the phone to DESTROY this mid range market...

I liked the color so decided not to buy a case however the phone is so slick that it kept sliding off various surfaces so I am waiting for my new clear case case to arrive. Fingerprint reader is very quick but the facial recognition is sporadic particularly compared to my daughters Apple 12.

Unfortunately I'm not able to review some features of the phone because it is not yet serviceable. This is really up to the buyer to contact your service provider first, of course. Spectrum (specifically) does not service this unlocked device until sometime maybe in January 2021. Possibly to due with 5G service and it being a super new device. Just an FYI as we're now left with two brand new wonderful phones without service and two quickly dying old phones trying to hang in there another month.\n",

When on a call I'd be talking and at random times the other person could not hear me at all. This also happened when I had them on speakerphone. Obviously, this is something very important when it comes to purchasing a phone: the other person must be able to hear you during the call. Next, when taking a photo with the flash in the photo came out really blue and foggy. However, if no flash was used during the day and or night mode the picture came out very nice. I also did notice that the phone's battery percentage would go down when not in use. I've never had these type of problems with any of the many Samsung phones I've owned. Hopefully the next one will be alot better as I do not plan on ever switching to an iPhone.\n",

      "Review_Description: I like this phone so much that when mine was smashed intentionally into the concrete, it took two times at full human strength of a 6 foot tall man to make it not work anymore. I did not hesitate to replace it with the same SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G. The phone is great value for the money I spent. I also recommend this too. https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Samsung-Tempered-Protector-Scratch/dp/B08KFPG514/ref=pd_rhf_ee_s_rp_c_2_5/144-6656309-3446512?pd_rd_w=9j7YN&pf_rd_p=c5176ee3-b609-4196-9e4e-395444c24cf6&pf_rd_r=BDX5XCHK1A6WH7VR80A1&pd_rd_r=51830fd5-f828-4c59-b33e-a7d6c5e8e88d&pd_rd_wg=3qwHk&pd_rd_i=B08KFPG514&psc=1\n",

      "Review_Description: I had a green tint when i would put the brightness below below 20% probably which would make other apps have a kind of gray and blurry view on the phone. After reading the comments i disregarded them because I knew about the phone but unfortunately I got a defected one . My mom and uncle got the same phone and theirs are fine and work great but i think I'll buy a different phone after returning. I noticed it right after the box so I personally didn't get to experience the phone for more then an hour before boxing it up again.\n",

I haven't seen any of the issues stated yet though I will say the battery doesn't hold as long as was stated and the only issue I've had so far is my phone kept freezing when I would click on the wifi button and when I went to restart the phone it wouldn't turn back on after 20mins. It's fine now but time will tell.\n",

I'm a full-on nerd and would notice anything wrong or glitchy about a phone not to mention the way it looks... In my case I got an impeccable phone that performs impeccably and I couldn't be happier...My advice is to take the chance on this reseller and buy your phone. If it ends up being crap you can always send it back because you're buying from Amazon\n",

I will be returning it as soon as I can figure out which one to replace it with. Also, every time the black screen flashes it does a hit on the battery life. Have lost nearly 60% battery power in six hours, and I've had this phone less than two weeks. It was new in the box when purchased.\n",

      "Review_Description: The two reviews below are from the first two times I attempted to purchase and use this phone. Third time was the charm. The Bluetooth works fine, and I'm loving this phone!----------------The phone is very attractive, the sound quality is good, and the screen is large and the picture clear. But I had nothing but trouble trying to get my Bluetooth devices to hook up with it. After trying unsuccessfully to find a fix (both from Samsung and my auto manufacturer), and having to reboot by Fitbit multiple times today, I got so aggravated that I returned it (August 2020)I purchased this phone a second time (April 2021), hoping Samsung would have fixed the Bluetooth issues in the meantime. They have not. Again, I tried multiple solutions from multiple sources, from user groups to the manufacturer. But really, at these prices, should I have to do research to make it do something it's supposed to do anyway? I really wanted to love this phone, but it is useless to me unless the Bluetooth works with my car.\n",

I put in my sim card from my other phone it connected to my at&t service with no problem, the battery life is great, and the camera is awesome. I would only say i wish i had got the cool mint. But for anyone having doubts, my other phone was the galaxy zflip an that phone was a headache, this phone is way better thumbs up! üëç üëç\n",

      "Review_Description: My only complaint is that I bought this when it was the latest technology.  A couple of weeks after I bought it they came out with the S-21.  How are we supposed to stay up to date when they push them out so fast.  Having said that, I got the FE edition.  I haven't seen any difference than what the other versions offer.  It's just less expensive.\n",

The screen is super touchy and it'll think I'm touching something when my hands aren't even on it. The battery life is solid and the call quality is nice. I don't think it's worth 600$ and honestly I preffered my old galaxy j7 but unfortunately it broke and the only thing I could do was upgrade. Overall it's a decent phone, works fine, just a bit annoying and not very friendly for non tech savvy people.\n",

Don't let my lack of rating some of the options make you think that there is something wrong with them. I haven't fully gotten into those options so it would be unfair of me to rate them. I am well pleased with the function of the phone with everything that I have used. At a $599 price point this is a great phone that functions well without putting you in the poor house to buy it. I highly recommend it.\n",

There is no setting to turn it on and it is not automatically turned on. They claim that their unlocked phones dont get it. I live in a place with poor cell signal so this is a HUGE problem for me. Also it wont even send texts unless you have at least LTE. I have had 2 bars and it wont send a text. Who would have thought than an S series phone would be missing such a critical feature.\n",

For the price, this is an absolutely amazing phone. It's still a full-blown flagship, just with a plastic back and minus a camera. Huge battery. Maybe closer to the S20+ than the regular S20.I loved it so much, I decided to trade it in for a Galaxy S21+. But if you're not a tech snob like me, the S20 FE is a flagship without the extra flair.\n",

The screen shattered the very first time I dropped it. the front panel uses an older, cheaper, less crack resistant gorilla glass than the flagship models have. Even with a solid case the screen may still shatter if you are a klutz who drops their phone frequently. The battery life is enough to last most people a day to a day and a half. The fingerprint reader is slower and less reliable than either of my previous two phones (S9+ and OnePlus 7T), but it does work. The 120hz display is great!\n",

My first Samsung phone, wont be my last! No complaints with seller or phone.\n",

      "Review_Description: Bought this phone to replace my Galaxy S9. It was great for two weeks, but suddenly the screen started acting like a magnet stuck to a CRT television. Resetting the phone did not help and shutting it down and turning it back on only works for a few minutes before it returns to the glitchy screen. I plan on getting a replacement, but I can't rate it higher than two stars at the moment. I probably got a bad phone but I didn't drop it and it is in a very heavy duty case so I don't know what happened to cause this.\n",

      "Review_Description: So far so good, unboxing, this phone definitely felt like the higher end flagships. Sturdy, a bit thicker with some weight to it. Screen is flawless so far, very reactive, and the colors are vibrant. It is an unlocked phone for GSM and adapted to the SIM card very quickly. Switching from Galaxy to Galaxy is also very easy with Smart Switch. I believe it was a good buy considering the A line of Galaxies are hot on it's heels with a similar price\n",

One issue, my wife's phone lost network connection to T-Mobile, came back after reboot. Maybe need a new Sim card.\n",

Battery life lasts pretty long depending on what youre watching or doing. Charging takes awhile but if you turn on the fast charge its not so bad.\n",
