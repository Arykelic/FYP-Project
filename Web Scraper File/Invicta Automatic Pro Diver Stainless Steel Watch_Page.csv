Er nannte mir lediglich folgende' für ihn wichtige Faktoren:-Wasserdichtigkeit mind. 10 ATM-robustes Automatikwerk-Diver Optik-gute Verarbeitung-Uhr darf nicht zu groß sein-nach Möglichkeit unter 130.-Da ich mich mittlerweile gut bis sehr gut mit Divern auskenne' fiel mir sofort die Invicta ein. Sie ist meiner Meinung nach der ungeschlagene Preis-Leistungssieger im unteren Preissegment. Nachdem ich ihm dann Bilder gezeigt und ein paar Infos bzgl. Uhrwerk und Verarbeitung dargelegt habe' fiel der Entschluss recht schnell und ich musste die Uhr für ihn bestellen. Nun hat er sie seit knapp 4 Wochen und ist rundum zufrieden. Das robuste und zuverlässige NH35 Werk aus dem Hause Seiko tut seither brav seinen Dienst und besticht mit akzeptablen Gangwerten' welche aktuell bei ca. +8 Sekunden pro Tag liegen. Die Verarbeitung ist ungewöhnlich gut für den Preis' massive Ambandglieder' gehärtetes Mineralglas und eine ordentlich rastende Drehlünnette mit 120 Klicks. Und als zusätzliches „Schmankerl“ ist die Uhr mit einem Glasboden ausgestattet' welcher einen Blick auf Uhrwerk und verzierten Rotor gewährt.Kommen wir nun zum Fazit:Super Preis/Leistungsverhältnis' welches meiner Meinung nach in diesem Preissegment unschlagbar ist. Verarbeitung top' Uhrwerk zuverlässig' Optik toll (das ist natürlich Geschmackssache). Wer in die Welt der Automatikdiver reinschnuppern und nicht viel Geld ausgeben will' ist mit der Invicta bestens bedient!Falls Euch meine Rezension bei der Kaufentscheidung geholfen hat' würde ich mich freuen wenn ihr diese positiv bewertet:),Reviewed in Germany on 23 October 2018

Tag' Omega' cartier' Rolex' seiko' bulova before I got ill. They are all gone now. I am a antique clock repairer since 1985. So I ordered this invicta pro diver. When I opened the main box I saw the invicta watch box was covered in a flim. This is a very good sign. When I got to the watch it also was covered in watch flim. Excellent. I had to resize the steel bracelet which is easy to do if you have the watch pin tool. The watch feels and looks like a Rolex' I know this from having Rolex watches in my life. Time keeping looks good. The lume on the dial is just ok' but even with some of my Rolex watches that I had' you always had to charge the lume over a light for one full minute before you go to bed. I will test this tonight. As for water resistance I don't know how good this model is' However'  PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU LOCK down the screw down crown always. As a clock maker' when I opened the screw down crown to set the date and time for the first time' I got a small pin and a very small bit of Vaseline and put it on the screw before I closed it down into the watch. This will help the crowd to close right. I have not opened the back of the watch as yet. If I do I will put a pin size bit of Vaseline around the screw in back. The invicta logo on the said of the case is fine' you don't really see it until you point it out. Everything about this watch look excellent' and as a clock maker who had so many different top end watches I can tell you this' Invicta had made a fantastic looking watch that is The Invicta Pro Diver. I will update this review in a number of weeks from now. 16.04.2020,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 April 2020

As soon as you mention this watch you're belittled because it takes most of its design inspiration directly from a submariner and you can't afford the 6 grand. And also most who buy the watch will put a Bond NATO strap on it. I'm guilty on both accounts. (And i really dislike wearing steel bracelets). The same snobs also deride anyone who buys a quartz powered watch.(I have 12 or so). So then you go and buy this automatic and still can't win.I really like this watch. Yes there's a few design flaws but it's under £70 and the Seiko movement is a tried and tested reliable automatic.Obviously the overall design has the look it was going for. I don't particularly like the huge Invicta stamped on the side but truthfully once on it's difficult to know its there because of the polished finish. The bezel rotates anti clockwise 120 clicks. It's quite stiff but with no play at all. The hands are easy to see and the second hand has a nice sweeping motion at 6 ticks per second (21'600 an hour).The crown is screwed down to help with water resistance and once undone can be hand wound and then the time adjusted as normal. After i wound it for the first time and removing at night it hasn't stopped. Tolerance is huge at something like +- 40 seconds but after a week its still dead on.The lume is pretty awful and if you really stare at the cyclops over the date you can tell it's a little wonky. I removed the bracelet straight away but it didn't feel quality like the rest of the watch. Even though the case measures 40mm the actual face only measures 28mm. For those (like me) who like the fashion of oversized watches this can feel a little small at first at a traditional size. However' it became less noticeable after a short while.Weighs 154g with the bracelet and 90g with the NATO.So'Great design.Comfortable.Dependable Seiko automatic movement.Affordable.Terrible lume.Dodgy cyclops.Can look a little small.Less than cheap feel to the bracelet.Recommended.(Pictured for comparison TW Steel 50mm case 37mm face. Accurist 43mm case 37mm face.),Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 January 2019

Sostituito' il prodotto sostitutivo dopo 48h ha espulso un fil di ferro da sotto la ghiera. Sostituito' attendo il terzo (3°!!) orologio. In un anno è decisamente troppo' nonostante sia un bell'orologio' motivo per cui mi ostino a vedere se ne è mai stato prodotto uno funzionante.UPDATEAnche il 3º esemplare ha smesso di funzionare' non voglio neanche commentate' girateci alla larga.,Reviewed in Italy on 30 November 2018
