I am not going to waste your time with redundant information like the specs or any picture of me unboxing the phone or anything like that. The Brand UMIDIGI is a smaller cellphone company originating out of Shenzhen' China and they sell via online channels like Amazon.com where I was able to pick up this handy little device for $124.99 after a 5% discount coupon was applied. Sweet Deal!!! I got my old B!_ phone stolen in Boston a few days ago and I wanted the most bang for my buck as I have been on a trend of losing at least a phone a year since 2015! So since losing my iPhone 4' 4s' 5s' I  got tired of paying premium prices for my devices.  Enough Back story! You get the picture' I am a budget phone consumer like yourself.Pros:1)The Device came quickly' Thanks Amazon Prime! Loving the quick shipping at ZERO additional cost!2)Box comes with standard goodies like the Breathing Crystal color UMIDIGI A5 Pro phone' along with charger/cable' basic screen protector' and a cool cover for the phone.*Maybe UMIDIGI can start shipping a TRANSPARENT protector with the device since the company seems to focus heavily on the aesthetics of the phone which is absolutely phenomenal! I love taking it out of the case to see that reflective blue ceramic-like material! A+ on the design and premium feel.3) The phone is snappy and responsive! All my contacts' apps' and other data was quickly transferred and I was up and running via Wifi download of my apps. I have since brought the phone to some retail shops to compare touch sensitivity' app open/close response time' camera app features versus much more expensive brands. And comparatively' the UMIDIGI was a solid 4 out of 5 versus most major Android Device Brands such as S@m-u^g' P!x%l' etc. On most apps' the Umidigi opened up equally as fast as the "Big Name" rivals or +/-  1.0 to 2.0 milliseconds slower on more complicated apps or games like Toon Blast. So' for  $124.99 vs  $599 vs $799+' I am totally okay with losing a few milliseconds to open an app on my lesser-known but EQUALLY as Premium feeling UMIDIGI.4) All the typical specs' details' gadgets' assorted tech wizardry work as stated. Android Pie 9.0 right out the box' plus an immediate update from the manufacturer all make the device look' operate smoothly with the latest security patch available.MT6763 CPU runs as one would expect' it cannot beat the latest Samsung S10 chipset but for everyday functionality' one should be fine. If you are a technophile' this may not be enough for you. With 4GB Rom/32 GB Ram I feel totally satisfied with the amount of operational space/speed I get for the cost. Besides' the MicroSD slot can fit up 256 GB.Battery = 4150mAH' more than enough for the everyday user and is actually a larger size battery than many phones higher in price. So far' I have maxed out on about 12-15 hours of use in the day without feeling worried.Screen: 19:9 Ratio' 6.3 inches at 2280X1080 Pixels. That's a lot of Pixels for the money! FHD+!Phone Network & Service: This thing is a workhorse in terms of connectivity. It has so many bands it is bound to work with your GSM network in America' Europe' China' wherever! I popped in a $60 Mint Mobile Sim Card and BAM' instant phone service' SMS' MMS. I also have a German Sim Card in Slot 2 and both run at 4G! That is so important because many dual sim phones you sort of have to choose which sim will be the Superior dominant sim and put that one in Slot 1 because many brands only support 3G or even slower in "what I call" the Slave Sim slot 2. 😄 Also' a lot of dual sim phones don't have a 3rd slot for the MicroSD so you can have DUAL Sim OR 1Sim + extra Memory. This device gives me dual 4G in America/Europe and I still have room to put the (up to) 256 GB memory card! Win-Win Plus Bonus Points!.....Now to the reason the phone gets about a 3.8-4.0 out of 5 Stars from me..THE CAMERA and Everything RELATED To the CAMERA: The Good' The Bad' and the Even WorseThe GOOD:𝐓𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞  𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐂𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐚 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 with 16MP +8MP+5MP cameras for depth' wide angle' bokeh effect and all that jazz.Also' kudos on a 𝟏𝟔𝐌𝐏 𝐅𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐭-𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐚  ! A lot of companies usually skimp on the front camera and give like a 5MP or 8MP frontie.The 𝟏𝟐𝟎 𝐃𝐞𝐠 𝐄𝐱𝐭𝐫𝐚-𝐖𝐢𝐝𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐚 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞 does give your shot a much bigger viewing area but I believe it is at the cost of sharpness and detail. If you look through my pictures at Grammy's house' I took a shot of a bedroom in the exact position to show how much more image you get when in Wide Mode. Cool' but sharpness/noise are clearly apparent.𝐕𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐨 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 is very decent in natural lighting on both front/rear cameras. My selfie video was too sharp' but it could be that I freak myself out with this whole Selfie Culture. LOL. I may upload it to this review or maybe in another blog elsewhere.The BAD:𝐅𝐎𝐂𝐔𝐒 𝐒𝐏𝐄𝐄𝐃 is super shady. This may be because I am not familiar with the device yet so I can figure the minute tricks to get an instant focus adjustment but I felt the quick focus of the camera was laggy.𝐁𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐡 𝐄𝐅𝐅𝐄𝐂𝐓 is pretty hit or miss. This effect is designed to soften the background to make the foreground image look sharper and keep the viewer's eyes focused on the central object but It definitely needs some fine-tuning adjustments because if you look at the image of the coffee mug with a plant' the bokeh effect seems to not know where to begin or end. It blends into the foreground image and some of the background is included in the sharper foreground.The EVEN WORSE:THE ENTIRE CAMERA APP/APK needs to be scrapped and reworked (or fixed via an update?)... There are a lot of cool features but there is a lot of background adjustments to be made to make it feel quick' intuitive' and so on. I feel like if you are totally okay with setting up your camera in one way like an old school instant camera (with 35mm film!) to get a few shots every now and then' you will be fine with this app. But if you want to feel like you have a professional photo shooting experience' then you may need to sideload the Google Camera app or download an alternative app from the Play Store. It's the biggest negative to this device because I love to document even the mundane things of life with photos. And some of the other Camera Apps in Google Play Store have ads ... who wants to have to wait for an ad to load before taking a picture!? NOT Me' because by the end of the ad' one may have missed the pic opportunity!!!I actually don't want to disparage people from getting UMIDIGI products because I really believe in the brand! I got myself a BLU XL3 and my ex-girlfriend the UMIDIGI One Pro about the same time last year (8/2018) and her phone is still trooping along while my BLU has charging issues' power issues' random network connect/disconnect issues to name the major issues I had with my BLU phone. But you know what? The Camera App on BLU XL+ was awesome! All modes were accessible and the photo taking experience/image quality was impressive.THE BOTTOM LINE:Buy this beautiful phone if you are into cool design' need a secondary device' travel a lot and want to have several phone sims running at the same time (Business/Family) (America/Canada) (Girlfriend1/Girlfriend2) LOL>>>Regular usage is enough for you' you will get good daily battery usage.  Surfing the web' playing a few games' checking messages and emails all function as well as the big brands.But if you want a premium camera application (because the camera capability is built-in but not perfected) then some other photo app added to this phone may be enough. As I said' for $124.99 plus $4.99 in the app store' you could have a superb budget phone. Hope you like my review' give me a "like" or "thumbs up" or whatever if you found this useful!

But as a dupe' its amazing. Picks up touch fast. Super bright display. Comes with a screen protector already installed out the box' and a soft shock resistant case is included as well. Beautiful packaging. I can live with the Micro usb charger because the battery life is outstanding. I can go without charging my phone for anywhere between 10+ hours to the next day' depending on if im at work or not. Call me spoiled' but I wish there were some nice earbuds included but for this price' I can get my headphones from anywhere. Sound quality is ehhhh but its manageable with a headset or speaker connected. Latest android build-9.0 Pie. Video playbacks and game play lags a bit but it definitely is playable.Overall a great buy guys. I definitely recommend it and this seller' especially if you have Amazon Prime. Showed up even faster than predicted.Thank you Eco Umidigi 🙂🙂🙂,Reviewed in the United States on 26 August 2019

You won't find a phone to match the quality for the price.ProsGreat cameraAmazing quality screenVery fast and responsiveNegatives with at least the phone I receivedCharges very slow. May have something to do with a solder point where the charge port is.The speaker sounds a bit tiny sound wise.I am getting a replacement phone to hopefully fix the charging issue. I will update once I have some time with it.I do however' recommend this phone. Speed wise this thing loads pages and videos faster than my previous Galaxy s9. The 1080p screen is fantastic.Update: apparently this phone doesn't have the fast charge feature. My replacement phone however has better sound.Still love the phone!!,Reviewed in the United States on 27 November 2019

How is that even possible?! I absolutely recommend no one ever purchase this phone or brand as it has proven to be nothing but a waste of money most expensive piece of toilet paper I've ever used in my life!!!!! I've resorted too inserting my SIM card into my sons "toy phone"' ( my old phone) just so I don't lose out on any more job opportunities I juat can't believe how much this piece of crap has costed me. This company and brand should be ashamed of themselves for how much they misrepresent their product it is the holy Grail of the worst phone I've ever had in my life mind you as I said before I have always opted for the cheaper and or free phones this is worse then I could ever even imagine pretty sure I'm traumatized from purchasing a phone at this expense ever again. I can't stop obsessing over how much people should never purchase this product ever unless you want to be stuck in a 2G 3G warzone I've never had any 4G or 4G LTE ever on either one of the products nor have I had to reset my phone this many times in one day ever in my life 😡😡😡😡,Reviewed in the United States on 1 February 2020

You get a large screen with bright colors and quick processor. The phone falls short in a few areas but those can be considered personal preference. This phone would be great for young children and someone who wants a great phone without paying a car note one for one. This phone is a great experience.Pros. The phone has a great screen with amazing colors.  The finger reader is the best I think they have put on any phone I have used. Runs really smooth I have a ton of apps. the phone camera take quality pictures.Cons The phone still has micro usb to charge even in this price range I think type c would have been a better choice. The camera software is heavy making it feel sluggish. more internal memory would have made this a perfect phone.,Reviewed in the United States on 13 April 2020

The screen does curve at the edges and cuts off text in the corners of the device. It is somewhat of an annoyance when one is try to check the content that is usually displayed in those areas (time' battery percentage).Battery:The battery life on the device is excellent. I can use the device the entire day and still have more than 60% battery life left at the end of 10-12 hours.Processor:The processor on the device is not the most powerful one which explains the battery life. It is not the most powerful device for multitasking. This is especially noticeable when the device is installing applications from the store in the background.Camera:The camera is the biggest shortcoming of the device. The camera takes too long to focus which can make one miss the subject of the photograph. Once focused the resolution is good.Storage:The phone comes with 32GB of storage. The system takes about 23GB of storage leaving very little room for documents' pictures' music. The good thing is the expandable storage. microSD card is not optional if you would like to store anything on the device.The phone was delivered very quickly even though it was shipped from China.,Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2019
