When I went to Samsung store I was told the phone is not under warranty. But when I bought the phone it was clearly mentioned that it has 1 year warranty. When I called Amazon customer service' I was asked to reach Seller. It's been 3 weeks that I sent a message to the seller but did not get any response. Bad experience with this purchase.,Reviewed in India on 20 November 2021
