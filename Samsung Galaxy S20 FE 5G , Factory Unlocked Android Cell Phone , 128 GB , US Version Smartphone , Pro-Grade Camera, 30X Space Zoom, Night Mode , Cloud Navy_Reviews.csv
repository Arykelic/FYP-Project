https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UuyU7HsPL._AC_US60_SCLZZZZZZZ__.jpg,Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G | Factory Unlocked Android Cell Phone | 128 GB | US Version Smartphone | Pro-Grade Camera| 30X Space Zoom| Night Mode | Cloud Navy,Leonardo,5.0 ,Tengo prácticamente una semana con el equipo y no me arrepiento de nada' vengo de un galaxy s8+ y el salto es muy bueno' quería un s20+ pero después de tantos videos de análisis que ví me decidí por este s20 fe ya que no le pide nada al plus' solo el tema de que la parte de atrás es de plástico pero seamos sinceros la mayoría lo ocupará con funda así que estarás poco en contacto con esa parte. Voy por partes:Tiene: carga inalámbrica' carga reversible' snapdragon 865' resistente al agua y polvo' 6 de ram' 128 de almacenamiento' tasa de refresco 120' pantalla Amoled' batería 4500 mha' Cargador "mexicano" pero de 15w yo te recomiendo que compres uno de 25w cuando hagas tu pedido para que tengas carga súper rápida ya que es lo que admite el teléfono' la entrada es USB c' trae pinchito' admite tarjeta SD' solo un SIM' si se puede usar en México sin problema yo lo ocupo con Telcel sin problema.No tiene: pantalla curva que en mi caso agradezco ya que algunas áreas en las pantallas curvas son difíciles de alcanzar' me pasaba mucho con mi s8+' no trae funda por lo que recomiendo que compres una al mismo tiempo que hagas tu pedido del celular para que cuando te llegue tu equipo puedas usarlo con su funda y estés más seguro :). No tiene entrada de audífonos 3.5 por lo que si no tienes audifonos Bluetooth vayas pensando en comprar uno o comprar un adaptador' para mí no es ningún problema ya que los audífonos no los ocupo casi.Envío: me tardo en llegar una semana prácticamente pero todo dentro de los días que me marcó desde el inicio la fecha de llegada' pudo haber llegado antes pero en mi caso DHL no llega directo a mi ciudad si no que hace reconexión' pero todo eso está contemplado en la fecha de llegada así que todo bien. La caja llegó en buenas condiciones y toda sellada nada abierta solo un poquito arrugadita de una esquina pero se entiende por el manejo de la mensajería' nada agrave prácticamente imperceptible.Pago: pague lo que marca el precio en el anuncio' no tuve que pagar nada más ya que parece que los gastos de manejo vienen incluído en el precio anunciado' en México sin ser 5g y sin el procesador snapdragon el teléfono está en unos 16 mil y lo que pague que fueron $13'200 es un súper precio considerando que es 5g y trae el snapdragon.Rendimiento: lo he usado con los 120 hzs y me ha durado todo el día la batería' llegó con un 20% a las 9 pm. Creo que es un rendimiento bueno pero no el mejor considerando que juego prácticamente nada al día' mi mayor uso son las redes sociales' correo y aplicaciones del trabajo pero las ocupo mucho que compensa esa parte del juego así que no creo tengas problema para terminar tu día con algo de batería y si no una cargadita de 20 minutos y listo. El rendimiento ha sido de unas 7.5 horas de pantalla encendida.Cámaras: si considero que venía de un s8+ el salto ha sido muy grande' las cámaras tienen muy buena calidad y nada que envidiar al s20+ si no me crees ve los videos de reseñas y verás que no hay mucha diferencia por lo mucho más que pagas en el plus creo que el FE tiene mejor calidad precio.En resumen es un buen telefono' me gusta mucho el módulo de cámaras' el color que elegí fue el azul y me agradó mucho' se siente como un premium y luce como un premium' yo pensaba en darle una oportunidad a un Xiaomi' realme' poco etc pero seamos sinceros Samsung es Samsung y si trae un snapdragon es mucho mejor' estoy seguro que los Specs suenan fabulosos en otras marcas pero no creo que su calidad de equipo aguante el pasar de los años' yo uso los teléfonos un promedio de 3 años' siempre Samsung y los he dejado prácticamente como nuevos. Así que si quieres un teléfono bueno' bonito y que te dure unos años este es tu opción ideal' no te vas arrepentir.,Reviewed in Mexico on 2 December 2020

https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UuyU7HsPL._AC_US60_SCLZZZZZZZ__.jpg,Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G | Factory Unlocked Android Cell Phone | 128 GB | US Version Smartphone | Pro-Grade Camera| 30X Space Zoom| Night Mode | Cloud Navy,Shawn,3.0 ,I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One' and most obviously' was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it)' it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so' I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance' the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen' while not 4K' still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good' nice and crisp. I've done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography' all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid' but not the best in the market right now. You'll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also' you can't beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support)' you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size' while much larger than I was used to' still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though' as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But' if you've been reading up on the S20 FE at all' then you know that there are problems. First off' the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself' I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls' that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I'd say it works about 85% of the time' but when it doesn't' do you ever feel it. Adding on' the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad' but it's not flagship levels by any stretch. You'll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you're looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with' I'd look elsewhere.From what I've seen' the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes' my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There's undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released' but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no' at least for me. While I'm sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers)' I really haven't noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter' but that's about all I've seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE' I don't blame you.It really is a shame that I can't give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars' because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues' there's always the worry that time will make them worse. It's a genuine worry' I get that. But even with the problems' the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone' but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse' but for right now' I'm more than happy with it.Edit (8/18/2021): I've dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It's been a little less than a year' and the issues mentioned above have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay' maybe not daily use' per se. But enough that it's starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket' it's opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen' as suspected. This is a pure hardware messup.Here's the cold' honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone's screen. It's beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic "angry Amazon customer 1-star" review' but I'll refrain. There's still good here with the chip' customizability' and great battery life' but that stuff can only get you so far.Here's my advice: don't bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price' with better specs. It's still not the worst thing out there and I'm not tossing it in the trash just yet' but it's definitely the last Samsung product I'll be buying. So disappointing' but I couldn't keep this review a 4-star in good conscience.,Reviewed in the United States on 18 November 2020

En tanto a la pantalla lo único que me ha pasado es que un par de veces después de desbloquearlo no reconoce mis gestos o cuando toco la pantalla en algunas partes' desconozco el por qué. Fuera de eso me funciona de maravilla la respuesta tanto que juego COD mobile.El sonido es muy bueno porque tiene un par de bocinas con sonido estéreo que te hacen tener una gran experiencia al consumir contenido multimedia.Los métodos de seguridad funcionan bien' nada del otro mundo pero bien. Sigo prefiriendo el lector de huella físico que el que tiene integrado pero tarda un par de segundos en responder. El desbloqueo facial es bueno pero podría ser mejor.Las cámaras soy muy buenas y puedes grabar a 60 fps en 4k' en esta configuración no tiene estabilización pero para una toma estática va de maravilla. La cámara frontal es muy buena y reconoce el rostro para saber si tiene que ampliar la toma en dado caso que detecte dos rostros.La batería' 45000 mAh dan super bien para un día de uso empezando desde las 8 AM hasta al rededor de las 10 de la noche cuando ya estás en casa y lo puedes comenzar a cargar. El cargador que viene de fábrica en mi caso fue el tipo americano de 15w y carga suficientemente rápido. Lo anterior con la pantalla a 60 Hz. No he podido probar la pantalla un día completo o una carga completa en 120 Hz.El rendimiento es bueno' 6 gb de ram son buenos aunque con 8 sería perfecto. Aún así el snapdragon hace un gran trabajo en el rendimiento' no se traba jugando o navegando' no se calienta por el uso' claro siempre y cuando le des un uso normal.Los contras que le encuentro al teléfono es que sí extraño el Jack de 3.5 mm para los auriculares' tengo que ocupar unos Bluetooth que tengo. Es difícil encontrar accesorios cheveres y una mica específica para la pantalla porque aún es un teléfono relativamente nuevo. Quiero resaltar que aun con una mica de cristal templado lee bien mi huella pero el cristal que conseguí no le quedó a la perfección aún así el chiste es que lo proteja.Los pros o puntos a favor son demasiados por todo el extra que ofrece además de las cosas buenas que ya mencione. Samsung te ofrece grandes cosas como la carga reversible e inalambrica' filtro de luz azul (es buenísimo para la vista y lo recomiendo)' conexión a Windows (tiene alianza con Windows haciendo que sea muy fácil vincular el teléfono con un equipo de computo Windows y poder recibir notificaciones' hacer llamadas' transmitir la pantalla del teléfono en la computadora' etc)' Dex (vuelve tu teléfono como una laptop)' puedes grabar la pantalla del teléfono directamente desde los accesos directos y la barra edge deslizando desde un costado de la pantalla' también se ilumina el borde de la pantalla con las notificaciones que configures entre muchas cosas más. Es una gran opción y lo recomiendo.,Reviewed in Mexico on 9 January 2021

Además ésta versión era la versión 5G lo cuál me deja aún más contento' sé que en México aún no tenemos red 5G pero al menos estar preparado para cuando ocurra es lo ideal.Lamento mucho que Samsung México no lo venda en versión 5G.La duda de muchos es si funciona con las redes de México y la respuesta es sí' viene desbloqueado de fábrica y a mi me funciona muy bien' tengo un chip de Telcel.,Reviewed in Mexico on 3 January 2021

That makes me feel lured into something I wasn't expecting.The phone is a solid overall phone with premium performance for the price due to sacrificing the build quality by making the back plastic and the screen gorilla glass 3 instead of 6.Doesn't matter to me as I wanted an unused device (battery) with a top notch processor for the smallest price point.I'm still slightly upset about not getting 8gb as was listed when I purchased which is why I didn't rate 5/5.,Reviewed in the United States on 4 October 2020

De muy buena calidad y ofrece buenísimas prestaciones' es fluido y rápido además de que su cámara es idéntica a la de un S20+ solo que con menos zoom (lo cual ni utilizas tanto realmente). Es la mejor manera de adquirir este equipo por qué en México solo venden la versión 4G y con exynos :( pero este equipo es la mejor versión (5G y snapdragon) y tiene una gran diferencia de precio (yo ahorre más de 4 mil pesos a diferencia de comprarlo en México)  El equipo viene sellado y súper cuidado' sin duda la mejor manera de comprarlo.,Reviewed in Mexico on 2 December 2020

Me quede impresionado ya que llego antes de lo esperado.  Llego el equipo en buenas condiciones y totalmente sellado' con su cargador y su cable.  Decidí comprar este producto liberado ya que según tengo entendido viene con la versión de Snapdragon. Al venir de un celular de huawei (y al no tener acceso a las aplicaciones de Google) opte por comprar un Samsung de tal manera que ya habia tenido Galaxy S3 hace bastantes años. Estoy fascinado con su pantallas amoled (característico de Samsung) su calidad de imagen y video' sin olvidar su fluidez ya que cuenta con 120hz (ajustable a 60hz). Me encuentro satisfecho con la compra' sin embargo' el unico "pero" que le pongo es... He leído otros comentarios que hablan de un "buen rendimiento'' y sinceramente por horario de trabajo le he dado un uso básico' visitas a redes sociales espontáneas durante el día. Siendo ya la 5 pm tengo menos de un 55% de bateria tomando en cuenta que casi no lo uso en horario de trabajo. Mi experiencia con Samsung siempre su batería es mala y alargo plazo tiendes a fallar mucho sus baterías (experiencia a equipos anteriores). Quisiera saber si alguien más le ha pasado?

Puedo decir que no siento que sea de mejor calidad este Samsung que un Xiaomi con las mismas características.Otra cosa es la cámara' las selfies di mi otro cel tenía 20MP de la cámara frontal y éste es de 32MP' hice la comparación de las tomas y me gustaban más como salían en mi Xiaomi.Lo que no le discuto a este cel es la cámara trasera' es buena' pero se calienta muchísimo el teléfono al usar la cámara.Para terminar' siento que la pila no me dura mucho ni por que le activé el modo de ahorro de energía y tampoco uso el cel para jugar' no tengo ningún juego en mi cel.Y por el precio' la verdad me ubiera comprado otro xiaomi con mejor rendimiento' pero quise probar el samsung por sus cámaras y la verdad es que no vale la pena por la cámara. Quise regresar el cel pero en Amazon decía que este producto no era elegible para devolución.Otro punto malo es que no tiene grabador de voz' tuve que bajar una aplicación gratis que tiene muchos anuncios buuu.

Me corre juegos pesados con una fluidez que asombra' no he tenido ningún problema de sobrecalentamiento y las pocas veces que aumentó su temperatura' bajó muy rápido.La batería' dependiendo del uso que le des y la fluidez que tengas activada en la pantalla (120 hz o 60hz)' puede variar entre 7 y hasta 10 horas de pantalla' en mi caso es suficiente para llegar al final del día (siempre tengo encendidos los 120Hz y hasta el Bluetooth y la batería no se drena rápido).La cámara trasera es muy buena para foto y video' aunque la frontal para selfies pudo ser mejor' pero no me quejo mucho ya que hace un trabajo aceptable.Sin duda es el mejor celular que he tenido.,Reviewed in Mexico on 20 February 2022

Las cámaras son excelentes y cuentan con una resolución e interpretación de colores muy balanceados y el modo noche es una maravilla las fotos en cuartos muy oscuros las saca tan claras como si fuera de día.Pero como dije el celular no decepciona el qué decepciona es el estado en el qué lo envían' ya que desde que habres la caja te das cuenta que no protegen de movimientos o golpes bruscos a la caja del dispositivo qué viene dentro y va totalmente suelto. De ahí una vez qué sacas tu articulo te das cuenta que ya ha sido habierto ya que la caja dónde viene el celular no traía los sellos oficles de Samsung' si no más bien un sello común y corriente que puedes conseguir en una papelería' una vez que rompes dichos sellos y abres la caja para ver tu celular y revisas los documentos que suelen traer un celular "nuevo" te das cuenta qué la garantía del dispositivo no viene dentro' reafirmando una vez más que la caja fue abierta antes. Después de 20 días de uso del celular el botón de BLOQUEO/ENCENDIDO' se comienza  aflojar y se termina cayendo dejando al botón incerbible. y sin la hoja de garantía dentro de la caja te ponen en un grave predicamento ya que no puedes exigirle una garantía a Samsung porque no cuentas con la hoja. afortunadamente ésto me sucedió antes de cumplirse el mes de oportunidad que te da Amazon para regresarlo y pude devolver el equipó pidiendo mi reembolso' pero si esto hubiera pasado después del mes y sin la hoja de la garantía del celular hubiera tirado 14 mil pesos a la basura.

Your touchs will be misread causing random inputs and jitter. This is a recording of how the phone is recognizing my inputs when using two fingers in alternating succession as well as when swiping with two fingers. This effects everyday use in subtle but frustrating ways. From taps being read as scrolling to unplayable multitouch games' the screen makes me miss my 3 year old galaxy S8. The most recent software update to fix the issue has made no difference. If you buy this phone it WILL have this problem. I was originally in the group that assumed mine wasn't affected' but it became hard to ignore the signs after a week.,Reviewed in the United States on 22 October 2020

Big battery' 120 hz' good cameras' recent cpu' and okay ram. Well all this stuff would have made this phone a keeper except the touch screen issues. This is literally how the user communicates with the phone and allows you to access all these great features. Really stinks that an issue this big slipped through. Samsung has released 3 software updates trying to fix it' but still have problems with jittery scrolling' accidental touches' etc. This isn't something that can be fixed with an update in my opinion or it would be resolved by now. Look elsewhere' or if your brave chance it I guess. I thought I would get lucky despite all the bad reviews/complaints (check samsung forums). I don't mean to be a downer but I strongly advise to choose a different phone. I'm still looking myself. Good luck!,Reviewed in the United States on 28 November 2020

Most are widely inaccurate.Pros- Easy setup: I'm on Verizon and all I had to do was swap the sim card. I didn't have to take the phone to store' I didn't have to log in and change settings' etc.- The 120hz OLED screen is game changing (for me). I'm gamer and I could immediately notice how fast and responsive the panel is. Colors are vibrant and blacks are inky inky black.- Processor is light years ahead of S7. It's also running the 20 series flagship processor.- Camera is amazing.  3x zoom and wide lens. Yesss please.- I love the colors. I got the Orange.- Samsung's OneUI is a huge improvement. Very intuitive and very powerful. I've been setting up advanced Bixby routines. I honestly never thought i would use Bixby but I'm a believer now.- Larger screen and battery than the S20- Very fast and responsive finger print scanner- Dual sim cards and up to 1TB of additional storage if you buy a micro sd card. I'm looking at you APPLE. Although Samsung will be removing the sd card storage slot for S21's for some reason.- Comes with a charger. APPLE!Cons- Face recognition is too slow for my liking. The finger print reader is more than adequate.- No 3mm headphone jack- Out of the box charger is not the best. You get a 15 watt charger even though this phone can handle 25 watts.In summary' if you can get this phone for 550 to 600 bucks... BUY IT.,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2021

Looking at online forums' this seems to be a common problem with this particular phone from Samsung. Seems like they tried to cut some corners to get the price down while still advertising the 120hz display and it didn't work out well. Not sure if it's something that can be fixed with a software update but it wasn't corrected as of the October 2020 OTA update. Not going to chance waiting around for a fix and being outside the return window. If you are experiencing odd behavior with your screen and touch sensitivity' you're not alone. Bummer as well because otherwise I loved the phone.,Reviewed in the United States on 19 October 2020
https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UuyU7HsPL._AC_US60_SCLZZZZZZZ__.jpg,Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G | Factory Unlocked Android Cell Phone | 128 GB | US Version Smartphone | Pro-Grade Camera| 30X Space Zoom| Night Mode | Cloud Navy,l2,4.0 ,Now that the price on this phone has gone down to $600' it is a very good deal for the price.The Snapdragon 865 processor is more than fast enough for anything I want to do. 6GB of memory is less than some other phones in this price range' but it is still more than enough for most people.The phone feels very solid despite the plastic back. If you use any kind of case' you won't even notice the plastic back.The phone supports 25W fast charging' but for some reason they only included a 15W charger in the box. Buying the 25W charger separately is a waste of money as well as a waste of the natural resources that were used on the 15W charger. Amazon sells decent 25W fast chargers for less than $15' so cheaping out on the charger is a real lame move by Samsung. You can search Amazon for 15W chargers that support "USB-C PPS" mode and are UL Certified.The screen looks beautiful when you turn on the 120Hz mode. This does burn your battery more quickly' but the battery is big enough that it still lasts all day.The screen has been very responsive to me. I have read bug reports about screen glitches for some people. Samsung has already released bug fixes that hopefully have fixed this. I advise only buying this phone from an authorized dealer with no hassle returns so you don't have to worry about this bug.The phone does have a lot of Samsung bloatware. I owned a Samsung S-series phone several years ago and the bloatware was really bad then. This one is much better. You don't even need to create a Samsung account to use the phone now. Most of the Samsung bloatware (other than the camera app) won't work if you don't have a Samsung account' but if you never use it' this isn't a problem. There are several tutorials online about disabling all the bloatware if you never want to see any of it on your screen.The triple camera setup on this phone is very good for this price level. The telephone camera works great up to 3X in good light. Image quality deteriorates quickly if you zoom in past 3X or in lower lighting conditions. Telephoto cameras are getting rare in this smartphone price range' so I'm glad this phone has one. I really like using the telephoto lens for landscape and nature photography. The normal and wide angle cameras work better in lower light situations (including indoor situations)' though not as good as the iphone or Google Pixel phones. Pictures do tend look more processed than with some other phone cameras. Some people like the Samsung look. Other people prefer more natural looking photos. You should try to look at sample photos before buying the phone' since you cannot completely disable the Samsung photo processing.This phone comes with Android version 10 out of the box' which is one version behind the Android version 11 that the Google Pixel phones are shipping with. Samsung promises software support with 3 version updates' but that is a little misleading since 1 of those version updates will be just to catch up with the current Android version 11. Still' 3 years of bug fixes and security patches is better than what Samsung used to offer.,Reviewed in the United States on 29 October 2020

After a year of owning the S20FE' this phone is still great and performs perfect. I still love it.Last time I owned a Samsung phone was back in the TouchWiz days of the note 2. Since then for me it's been motorola and Google' but I decided to give Samsung a try again. I am so glad I went with this phone over the Pixel 5. At the time' the s20 FE was $100 cheaper than the pixel 5 and the reviews across youtube sold me on this phone. Having owned the G7 power and G power' having the extra battery life is important to me. At first I tried the A71 5G but it felt incomplete. I was not impressed with the build quality or the cameras' even the battery did not last despite being the same capacity as the s20 fe. I am so glad I returned the A71 5G and got this one just a few weeks later. I was not planning for samsung to announce this phone at all. Easily worth the extra $100. It feels more premium' and I prefer the matte finish on the S20 FE compared to the A71. The cloud white is so nice and universal' with hints of aura glow depending on the lighting. It has the finish to that of a CD. But as far as battery' out of the box with 48 percent I've been using the phone nonstop for a little over 2 hours now and I'm down to 27. That's pretty impressive considering the battery isn't fully calibrated. The One UI is great' the 120hz screen is super smooth and responsive and that SD 865 performance is very nice as well. The phone can keep up with me easily. Despite the lack of the headphone jack' I think the pros outweigh the cons. The screen' the build quality' the battery and the audio quality is very nice. 5G connectivity is fast with T-Mobile and the fact this phone supports wifi 6 capability' this phone is definitely future proof. This may be the start of something Samsung can move forward with. A premium device with flagship specs for less. I will definitely update the review as I have more time with the phone and upload some sample photos but as it is now' a solid 5 stars from me. You can't go wrong for $599.99. Flagship specs for a cheaper price' Samsung definitely got it right with the S20 FE. I can totally recommend. I'll definitely be sticking with this phone for a while' especially considering Samsung promised this phone 3 years of updates.*Update 1/21/2021*I've had the phone for a few months now and I just still love it as much as the first day I got it' the new One UI 3' android 11 update is definitely welcomed' the camera is still taking phenomenal pictures' and the battery is still holding up.  I was contemplating trading it in for the S21' but I think this phone is much better for what you get at the price it's offered.,Reviewed in the United States on 13 October 2020

For $635 ' the phone is quick the cameras look really cool on the back but I'm not a fan of how clear they look the picture is fuzzy and is always halfway zoomed in. Coming from lg Google phone from 2017 the samsung ui and ecosystem is mediocre at best' it feels really slippery and unfufilling like every app you open is opened on accident like you just slipped into this app. Counter intuitive power off process(its not the same as to power on wtf ). Bixby sucks to say the least' a lot of wireless half baked features that are impractical. But the phone seems reliable enough' I know how to maximize battery life like first changing the wallpaper to a black and white version' limiting 5g/network(I like how you can easily enable 5g if needed' but who really needs that much power?)' and of course keeping no apps running in the background' and putting the phone on do not disturb mode so it doesn't vibrate itself to oblivion' which is weird because the phone forces a lot of notifications even after you turn them off or minimize them. I expected a little cleaner software' honestly would have preferred a brand new s9+' but I couldn't find anything that wasn't refurbished. I turned the 120 Hz refresh rate off and boom the battery is lasting a couple days on the regular love 4500 MA battery. I like the glasstic back' but be warned there is a slippery feel to it so go to eBay and grab a quick 10 buck case to be safe. Overall I'm happy with the device. The expandable storage is very nice and I bought another 128 gigs for 30 bucks at target so I have all the memory I need and more! Just wish I could switch to the Google version of software but keep the Samsung hardware' because those pixels are looking weak! Watching the iphone 12 commercial made me shrug and grateful I had this phone' the price' the value' and the vibe of my mint cloud samsung 20 fe is one that is pretty much unmatched! The box is the phone and charger' the speakers sound is a little above average. The fingerprint reader is solid and practical. Totally worth it.,Reviewed in the United States on 15 October 2020

Im switching over from the original Pixel XL. Wasnt thrilled enough with the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G lineup/availability. So I thought I would give this one a shot.  Overall its been a good first day with the phone.I popped in my Verizon sim card and after setup (see below) I immediately had cell service and 4G connectivity. No problems there.Setup was kinda a pain switching from a Google phone. I had my old phone backing up to Google drive. The setup process didnt quite help make a full transfer. It pulled in my contacts and app data' but didnt reinstall my play store apps automatically or transfer my SMS/call history. What I ended up doing was using the Samsung Smart Switch app. I installed it on my old/new device and it transferred every thing.  Contacts' SMS/call history' app data' photos' videos' etc. It even started automatically installing my missing apps. That was nice.Performance wise the phone feels pretty snappy and has a nice display.  I havent had a chance to play with the camera yet. Today was just 'get the phone up and running" day.My biggest issue is not with the phone itself but with the the original listing on Amazon when I purchased the phone a few days back. It said the phone had 8GB of RAM.  That was a selling point for me.  When I booted up the phone I check the settings and it says 6GB. I came back into this phones listing in Amazon and wouldnt you know' now it says the phone has 6GB of RAM. Hmmm... That kinda ticked me off.

But when I "upgraded" to this phone I was blown away by the staggering amount of bloatware and intrusive apps pre installed on this phone. The BIGGEST by far being Samsungs own software' it is everywhere! It has it's hands in everything and if you take the time to look through at all the permissions on this software it is staggering how much information about you it is allowed to collect.Now we all know that having a smartphone means some loss of privacy and that companies use the selling of certain information to offset the cost of the devices they are selling you. I understand that. But' again....maybe it's just me but I am not OK with the level at which they force this down your throat and the amount of preinstalled and (can not be removed or actually stopped) apps that have full permissions to ALL of your information.Yes it's a good phone' it should have a bit more ram for what it is' I like the SD card expansion slot ( I can't believe that has to be said) Snappy processor and camera is OK at best. I really expected more from what should have been Samsungs near flagship device for the time. Price seems to be going up again for some reason as well. When I bought mine in Febuary of 2021 it was 599 from Amazon themselves.,Reviewed in the United States on 14 March 2021

The phone registers ghost taps during rapid finger movements between two fingers which creates a dragging effect. It's very noticeable in first person shooter games where your character will suddenly look at a different' unintended direction.It remains to be seen if this can be solved via software updates. Samsung already tried (i have the latest patch) and the problem still persists. If they can't patch it within my return period' it's going back.Other than that' yes you get flagship specs at a midrange phone price.,Reviewed in the United States on 2 November 2020

After researching and narrowing my decision down to the Google Pixel 5 and the Samsung S20 FE 5G' I chose the S20 FE 5G. For me' it came down to being able to expand the memory and I prefer to have that option. So far' everything works great. I love the pastel color choices! Cloud lavender looks pretty and so does the Cloud Orange' but I had to go with my favorite color' Cloud Mint.The fingerprint reader is accurate and fast. When unlocking the phone' the bright light is a little blinding' especially if unlocking the phone in the dark. Face recognition works great and it unlocks well with my eyeglasses on too.For the battery life' it seems that it doesn't last long compared to my previous phone. With the S20 FE 5G' I noticed with my normal use (watching YouTube videos' using social media' surfing the internet' etc.)' I would have to charge it after a day' but with the Mate 9' I was able to use it for almost 2 days before having to charge it.I love the quality of the rear/front camera. The rear camera focuses well and the photos appear brighter/sharper which I like. The front camera is fixed and doesn't allow for autofocus when tapping on the screen' which I'm bummed out about. I hope this is something that will be fixed. The super steady mode is awesome!Included in the box: phone' charging adapter' charging cable' paperwork' and the sim tray eject tool. I do wish the charging cable was a bit longer and I wish it came with earphones' but it's not a big deal. I'll be buying a usb-c to 3.5mm headphone adapter. I do have Bluetooth earbuds' but I prefer connecting directly for better sound.When I received my package and I opened it up' it came with ZERO packaging' which I was unhappy about. You would think it would come with some protection with bubble wrap or air pillows to avoid the phone from getting tossed around in the box.

It's interesting that in 2020' a "budget" phone is 700 dollars but it is definitely a great value for the money. The cameras aren't as great as the regular S20 line up but they are a solid upgrade coming from the S8. Just make sure you have great lighting if you plan to use the ultra wide lens or telephoto because photos get very grainy in less than  ideal conditions. Battery life is solid. I work all week and when I'm not on my phone a lot' I easily get 2 days and squeeze  in a few hours from the next day if I really can't get to another charger. If I have a day off and I'm on the phone for hours'  I can easily make it to the end of the day at 20+ percent.The screen is great. Colors are bright and the quality 120 Hz refresh rate screen is buttery smooth to navigate. The phone is definitely bigger and closer to the Note 20 (non Ultra model) in terms of size so that takes some getting used to. Touch could be a bit better. Sometimes you have to touch the screen more than once to activate the screen or to select something. The fingerprint reader is an optical one so it's hit or miss sometimes. I have found that  if I pay attention to where I place my finger' it tends to recognize it more easily.  I just never thought I'd miss the one on the S8 considering the poor placement of the thing.  The stereo speakers can get nice and loud and are better than the single firing ones found on my old phone. Reviewers say that the sound is not as rich as the more premium version of this phone bit if you're coming from a phone that is over 2 years old with only a single speaker' you' enjoy them.. Definitely  get a phone cover because the plastic back does scratch and dent easily if you drop it on asphalt as I'm finding out. Haptics are another area where Samsung cut back on this model. The vibration feels close to that of the S7 in a rickety sort of way. To their credit' they have calibrated the vibration motor to react more like when you are moving the cursor around on a text box like that found in a pixel. Just don't expect a solid thump like on the note 10 plus or the S20s. 6 Gb of ram is plenty now but I may wish I had gotten a phone with 8+ GB in a few years after some OS updates. Only time will tell. Its a crazy time and hard to believe that phone prices have inflated the way they have but if you can get the phone on sale' it's a no brainer and very easy to recommend.,Reviewed in the United States on 28 December 2020

It was brand new in every way down to the box with factory seal.  Flawless condition2. Now keep in mind i switched from a much older galaxy S6. I dont care too much re the camera.  With these in mind' the phone works great and delivers all the performance you would expect.The ONE MAJOR thing to keep in mind: Even next to the old S6 (higher screen resolution)' the screen looks a little shabby when set at the same brightness.  The contrast of dark letters is not so crisp/sharp as a higher resolution screen.  i adjusted to this by increasing the brightness.  But that means much less battery life.3. Changing Sim/converting the phone was very easy and 5G network registered immediatelyConclusion: You have to be ok with a less sharp' less bright screen' and mid range camera.  You can overcome the screen a little by increasing brightness but then battery life is less.If you are ok with these trade offs' this is a great phone and delivered brand new just as advertised.,Reviewed in the United States on 12 June 2021

Maybe I'm late to the game' but wow. The difference between my old phone and this one are massive.- Good size' fits in my pockets (even most of my tiny girl jean pockets. Ladies' you know what I mean. Stupid small pockets.Cons:- the vibrate is terribly weak. I always keep my phone on vibrate but I can't with this phone. I can't feel or hear the vibration in my pocket or even when it's sitting on my desk right beside me. It's so bad.- the flashlight... my old phone would turn the flashlight on when you shook the phone a certain way. This one does not.  I have to unlock the phone and manually turn on the flashlight. Kind of a pain.Pro or con? The fingerprint sensor. At first' no matter what I did' it would not read my right thumb. At all. I had to remove it and redo it at least 3 times before it finally registered correctly. Now all my prints work just fine. You are only allowed 3 prints though and I would have loved 4. Oh well.Overall' I'm enjoying my new phone but there are several aspects that I miss from my old phone (like customizable keyboards).,Reviewed in the United States on 5 August 2021

I just switched from an iPhone 6s to this by switching out my sim card no problem. You should know that it doesn't come with a cable that will connect an iPhone with this phone' so purchase that beforehand if you want to switch over all of your settings' apps' etc... but you can get them transferred over via icloud.The camera is miles better than my old one' but the selfie' front facing camera is awful. It makes you look like marzipan' like its perpetually stuck on beauty mode. Its frustrating' but I'm not a selfie queen anyway' so I'm not too upset about it. But upset enough to give it 4 stars.This was the first phone I ordered from Amazon and I'm pretty pleased!,Reviewed in the United States on 30 November 2020

I am a Sprint customer and because of the merger and network confusion my phone thinks a 5/5 Sprint 4G LTE signal is  roaming and tried to grab the 1 bar TMobile signal..Now for the showstopper.  The touch hardware is complete and utter trash.  The October firmware update helped a bit.  The sensor array is in a horizontal/Vertical grid.  If you touch three points on the screen and slide any of those fingers past the same grid line as another finger' it drops the moving touch . 4 out of 10 times' and strobes like a series of taps the other 6. The strobing lasts for 1/10 second or so.  I used developer mode to show touches and can watch the touch just disappear.  Now if I place two fingers on each side of the screen so they're both on the same horizontal plane' and then move a third finger between them it drops touch and then strobes every single time.This really looks like an issue from the early days when companies were struggling to get multi finger gestures to reliably work.  Perhaps Samsung used a design made in 2006-2008 to maximize profits. Shameful.I pre-ordered this phone. I have never preordered any piece of hardware. I did it because "Samsung knows howmto make a phone. That is one thing they get right' unless it explodes...".  Well' apparently Samsung forgot how to make a touchscreen screen.... Yes' Samsung.  A screen.  That's your thing... You make screens. You screwed that up like a first time manufacturer.  And then you decided to sell it anyway. You even mentioned "Games" in your advertising.This is my third Galaxy S10 FE with this same issue.  Initial phone was Sprint branded (returned)' second was unlocked (waited two weeks for more information and spent over an hour on the phone with Samsung' the Requested replacement)' replacement phone has same exact issue.  Failing 3/3 of the time... That looks like 1... Yup.  100% failure rate. This is after the October firmware update that was supposed to fix the touch bugs.,Reviewed in the United States on 1 November 2020

Lombardo,3.0 ,This phone was intended to be a considerable upgrade for me. It replaced a 5 year old Nexus 6p. I will not deny that many aspects of it are better. It is undeniably faster. The  modified version of Android' Samsung's One UI' does not impress. It feels like bloat and has made some features harder to find. The through display fingerprint reader feels about 50% as reliable as a rear reader. The area that reads is very small (as is the area on a back reader)' but there is no physical surface feature to help you put your finger in the correct position. Most annoying to me is the lack of a headphone jack. I bought the phone knowing I'd give that up' but I assumed the only penalty of the usb-c to heaphone adapter would be the cost of purchasing one. The sound quality is far inferior through an adapter as compared to my previous phones with standard headphone jacks. Additionally using the adapter off of the power input port (usb-c) means your headphone cord comes out the bottom of the phone which is more annoying that I would have thought.,Reviewed in the United States on 6 November 2020

I ordered a 15 W Samsung wireless charging stand' but that failed in the same manner' Attempts to get help from Samsung's support organization resulted in an erroneous conclusion that the 15W charger did not support the S20 series of phones' but the newer 9W version did' so I ordered the 9W charger...and got the same results. I concluded that the problem had to be with the QI system within the phone' and initiated a return procedure to Amazon' intending to request a simple 'return and replace with identical item'' but that option was not available for the phone. Amazon indicated that to speed up the process' I should chat with their specialists before simply returning the phone for credit. After a one-hour 'chat' with Amazon technical help' who finally transferred me to Samsung technical help' who spent another hour before they concluded that I should take the phone to a Samsung-approved service center' which is 2.5 hours away' with no assurance that they could resolve the problem; even less probability they could resolve the problem in the same day...I processed the standard return-to-Amazon-for credit application. Then with a confirmation that the return was approved' I simply ordered another (identical) phone. On it's arrival' I quickly transferred all app' data' etc from the old phone to the new phone' swapped the SIM carrier (containing the SIM card and the external memory card). The new phone charges easily and quickly on both Samsung wireless chargers' even with the Samsung cover on the phone. Using the straight-forward Amazon process is simple and efficient' but when people get involved' the efficiency is subject to total loss' simplicity is gone' and patience becomes a victim.,Reviewed in the United States on 29 January 2021

I felt the upgrade after 2 weeks of use ( or even in an lesser time)' the s20 fe is not a phone you can easily hold with one hand' the plastic back may seem cheap' but' it grows on you' also it won't break as easily like a glass back. The front camera doesn't disturb you when you are watching videos' movies' pic etc. Gaming' it will run very smoothly. Battery' if the phone starts at 100%' by the end of the day it won't be fully dead (even if you have the 120hz screen' which is like spreading butter on bread' you won't go back to 60hz after using the 120hz).Once you get to play with the phone itself' you will notice this cellphone can compete or even win its sisters like the s20 or the s20 plus (heck it can probably bit the iphone11 just with its extra perks)For the price you get' you won't get rip off.

I have been a Motorola user with my last being the Moto 5G Plus.  That lasted only 2 years and then moved so slow and functioned so poorly I knew I had to research and move into the big leagues.  I am so thrilled with every aspect of this phone.  Its screen is vibrant and colorful.  Its video quality is superb and scrolling around and going between apps it moves like lightning.  I am extremely impressed with the camera and video quality as well.  Some complain about the selfie camera.  At first I was not happy but did my research on how to use all its features and now I am beyond thrilled.  Everything here far surpasses all my expectations.  Phone call quality is excellent and the audio from the speakers also shines.  Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze and music and audio books sound excellent.  This is all enough for me to love this phone but add in the battery life and it becomes a true winner.  With excessive use I get at least a full day out of it.  I never got half a day with my Motorola.  I have installed a 128 gb sd card for quality amount of storage.  This phone never falters and performs at the highest level all the time.  Finally I have a true quality phone and I just love having it and using it.  Highly recommend.,Reviewed in the United States on 7 October 2021

It’s a really good phone but I just personally didn’t like how lightweight it felt and how large it was' or that the case was plastic. It’s a very beautiful color though. My biggest complaint is the camera quality. I am an artist and I just need my pictures to be perfect' I use the iPhone SE 2nd gen and in my opinion the camera on it is much better. The S20 FE camera is a bit lighter' a bit less saturated' and almost...grainy? I only notice when I zoom in on fine pencil lines etc. but I’ve heard other reviews complaining of the same differences. Anyway' if you want a feather light' huge' very pretty phone with a pretty good but not perfect camera' this phone is okay.

When I say cheap' I mean lower cost and not necessarily bad quality. The plastic back is the best kind of plastic back you will get on a smartphone' definitely worth the price cut. It's actually better since you don't have to worry about it cracking if you drop it. Optical fingerprint scanner is a tad slower than what I'm used to' coming from the S8' but not slow and doesn't always unlock the first time. Battery life is what makes this phone great' lasts all day. I go to bed with about 35 to 45 percent left' go to sleep' wake up the battery has not drained and I charge it up in the morning before work. And with 120hz on all day. Fast screen is also another highlight' so much smoother than my S8.

The phone came undamaged' no scratches or smudges or anything. The battery life is great. I have a lot of screen time throughout the day' and by the time I go to bed at night I still have within the 70% range of battery left.

I will not buy a phone without an SD card slot so that eliminated the S21 and iPhone right off the bat.  My pictures are on the SD card and a backup of my call logs and SMS messages so I didn't really lose anything' the rest was backed up to my Google account.  I like that I can take photos and video in UHD at 21:9 aspect ratio so they fit my monitor.  Not bad for the price' I hope it lasts 4 years like my S7 did.

When I can get it to take pictures in focus they are nice but it is hard to tell until after if I am not specifically looking at the focus.Auto focus:The auto focus is painfully slow. Sometimes it just works but most times it works after a solid 1-3 seconds. Sometimes it takes >5s which just leaves me wondering what it is doing that could take this long.A perfect example is with normal lens everything in view of the camera is >20' away and it is just stuck out of focus for 3 seconds. Then the focus finally starts to wander after another 1-2 seconds it focuses.This seems to affect both the normal and zoom lense. I don't use the wide angle much but I would guess it has the same problem.The final result of this is if I'm in a hurry and not paying attention to the focus 1/4 to 1/3 of my pictures are out of focusFinger Print Sensor:It works okay most of the time. When in a dark environment it is blindingly bright if you don't cover the entire sensor before the back light turns on at ~100% brightness.Also sometimes the phone unlocks at 100% brightness too which just seems like sloppy programming that doesn't turn down the rest of the screen brightness before it displays it. It seems like it realizes it is dark after the phone has been unlocked for a 1/10 of a second.Overall it makes unlocking my phone in the dark painful at best. It feels like it is wrong more times than it is right so I close my eyes before I try unlocking it.Using the Camera kills other apps:I run and keep track of it on my phone. If I take some pictures while running more often than not the camera app will silently kill all apps running on the phone. So when I get done I find that my phone stopped recording when I took some pictures. There doesn't seem to be a way to stop the camera from killing everything. In testing I can get runs that are 39 seconds long by taking pictures shortly after starting the run.Note: Moved to this phone from the S9,Reviewed in the United States on 22 December 2020

I tried giving the Sony two chances because the camera features are nice but it wasn't enough enough to cover the flaws. The s21 ultra was fantastic' but I couldn't justify the price tag. This phone however was the best. 120hz screen makes it feel premium' but hardware is not slow to where to muddied the user experience. The screen is bright' and it's not 4k but you can't tell on a all device. The battery life also lasts so long because the resolution is not high. Samsung's interface is quite nice and it certainly makes using an android phone extremely enjoyable because it doesn't feel cheap like the Sony did. I will never use an iPhone again' and it was hard for me to find a great alternative. I was hesitant on getting a Samsung too because I was in love with Google products up until the pixel 5.

Battery life is much better considering how old my Note 8 is. Screen is a downgrade as its only 1080 over my 1440 but still great for what it is. The fingerprint reader is a double edged sword for me. Coming from a note 8' the position of the reader is an upgrade (the reader on the note is on the rear of the phone) but its reliability is iffy. Sometimes itll recognize immediately and other times it takes it a while to recognize it. This is a common issue documented elsewhere as well but not a deal breaker. The biggest issue for me is the camera. While the camera is better than the note 8s on paper' in the real world im having issues with it. The focus is terrible' especially while using flash. The camera consistently gets confused as to where it needs to focus and flash pictures are completely unuseable.

I purchased the US version Unlocked and took it to my local US Cellular store to have a clerk switch everything from my S8 to the S20.  I was told by the clerk after she attempted to get the phone registered and set up with US Cellular that the phone was not compatible with the network.  According to the Amazon add this phone is supposed to be compatible with US Cellular so I do not know if I was getting a line of BS from the US Cellular clerk because I didn't purchase the phone through them (even though they no longer carry the S20 FE) or if it's false advertisement on Amazon (hence the 2 star rating).  I was so livid yesterday after leaving the US Cellular store that I just went home' started the return process to send this phone back to Amazon' boxed it up and dropped it off at the local UPS Store.  If I want to upgrade my phone I guess I'm stuck with purchasing a phone through US Cellular so I know it will work.  I'm looking at the Galaxy A52 as it's similar in price to the Cloud Navy S20FE that I purchased through Amazon.  I refuse to pay $1'000+ for an S series phone.😠,Reviewed in the United States on 29 December 2021

Usually have 15% when I plug in the charger. The finger print reader has a quick response if you find the EXACT spot on the screen. Screen is rich with color and response' but you'll need to adjust sensitivity if you use a screen protector. The phone has to many features to go over here' I will say that I'm only about 40% into discovery of moderate research of all the settings.

Even with the "block accidental touches" option turned on' it is twitchy and very unpleasant.The phone does stream phone calls and music to my hearing aid via Bluetooth' which was what I bought it for' so I'm going to keep it - but I hate it and may store it in a foam-rubber-lined steel box to keep it from unlocking and starting some unwanted app.The typical Samsung bloatware is present and can't be deleted or disabled by someone as un-tech-savvy as me.  Same for the google pestware.  But I knew that from the git-go so can't complain.Still' listening to music is a blessing!

I am phasing them out' replaced my iPad and my third iPhone like the other two were acting sketchy ( blue screen of death and the jitters on the X) and when this laptop is soon to get replaced as well) Apple nows how to present their goods' kinda like Tiffany but w/o the diamond. Anyway while the packaging is as nice the S20 fe is Amazing. Easy to learn' fantastic camera and switching all my contacts' calendars  and numbers took seconds without a cable! the best part at least to me was the pleasant surprise of finding that when I changed over my sims card that I could also install a hell of a lot of memory behind the sims card (I installed a gig card as that was all I had kicking around for my digital camera) and you can have your files and photo saved directly to it! Brilliant! I have to say that 90% of the apps I had on the X I down loaded through the google and Samsung apps stores so I now have two stores vice one which is nice and both verify the apps are virus free. It is also 5G which will be nice when I get it in this area and I also understand that this phone is good for overseas travel on vacations or business. The apps that come with this phone are intuitive unlike Crapple which I never mastered. This isn't simple by any means but it is much easier to learn once you down load the book from the web.

I'm at about the 6 month' and now the device gets warm when it's taxed or the weather is a little warm.  And the battery life' whuch is still great' and dropped down significantly.  Love the phone.  Very concerned about the longevity. Particularly as i come up on summer in floridamark Edit:  one month in' and I love it!  Battery lasts all day' and I'm on my phone nonstop.I'm used to the change in buttons and actually like them.  Put in settings so power options do come up now. Like the screenshot method' mostly.Got a supcase military grade unicorn beetle case so it's well protected.  Signal is great on tmobile.  5g is slower than 4g' so I turn it off.  but I'm out in the middle of nowhere.Touch screen works perfectly even under double acreen protectors!  Updates get sent all the time.  So worth it!And my mom is blown away by the telephoto lens.  For me it's a fun binoculars' but pretty mushy picture quality at telephoto distance.  S9 couldn't do that at all. The close up distance/focus is much better than my s9.  The rest is pretty similar.---It's only been a couple days but so far so good. None of the touch screen or overheating issues a few people listed on the internet.I took very good care of my S9' but it was overheating often. This is night and day difference.I thought the volume buttons above the power button would take some getting used to' but actually the only downside is taking a screenshot is more difficult. Oh' and the power button no longer turns it off! Although I've read There are some workarounds for that. Otherwise you have to go up in the menu.I love that it's the same width as my old phone' but taller. Gives me more space but I can still hold it.I absolutely hate that there are no good colorful heavy duty cases out for it yet. Come on OtterBox!I wanted to go with the S10 because I was nervous reading reviews' and how new this was. But this was cheaper' and so far I'm very happy with my choice.Please note' red it definitely an orangey red.  I went with red so it would be more visible if all I could find for now was transparent cases. But if I could go back I would definitely choose purple again.I've also read a lot of people turn the 5G off because it's not available everywhere and you don't really want it constantly switching between 4G and 5G. 5G was coming in pretty good for me out in the boonies with T-Mobile. I did switch it to 4G yesterday and that also worked fine during a trip.Transferring information using Smart Switch actually worked really well for me. My S9 main Drive was completely full.  The SD card was half full. This brought over ALMOST everything perfectly' and it wasn't even very slow.  The only things it didn't bring over were  paid apps that I had installed with a different Google account. I had to add the rest of my Google accounts and do those by hand. Not sure if that would have been any different had I installed all the Google accounts first.I would say it's very slightly brighter than my S9. I don't have a problem with the camera being on the screen.Haven't had great luck with a fingerprint yet' but I do need to redo it since I put a screen protector on anyways.Happy happy!,Reviewed in the United States on 27 November 2020

I have had Samsung phones exclusively since about 2013 when I bought the Note 3 and thought for sure I would never buy from another manufacturer. At first I was pleased with the phone. Then about 6 weeks after purchase I got out of a movie to find my phone screen had cracked inside my pocket' nothing else was in there at the time. The screen is made of inferior materials to the ones in the flagship phones. I called Samsung customer support' after much back and forth managed to get a refund for the price I paid for the phone.

Occasionally it will even refuse to read so many times in a row I have to draw my pattern to unlock.Final problem: when I'm taking pictures with it' sometimes the camera app will "freeze" for 10-15 seconds at a time. It will seem like it's working' but just won't take a picture' no matter how many times I jam that take-a-picture button on the screen.

Replacing my LG Style 6' which measures over 7"' this Samsung phone is smaller but still comfortable to use in most regards.  Most phones I and my wife have had these past several years have their fingerprint reader on the back of the phone' which is much easier to use and more comfortable.  The Samsung S20 FE has a fingerprint reader embedded on the bottom of the screen' which is a bit awkward to use.  But the fingerprint reader is fairly accurate providing you follow the directions and scan multiple areas of your fingertip.  The screen is vibrant with deep colors & good contrast.  Since my phone is primarly a phone that I occasionally use for texting' I haven't used the camera yet nor do I use all of the features associated with video.  I have my dozen or so apps that I use frequently' and they all work well on this phone.  There isn't much bloatware installed by Samsung; most of it is installed by Google.  I do seem to get a bit better connection with this phone.Setup was a breeze.  I use ConsumerCellular as my carrier' and all I had to do was move my SIM and microSD cards from the old phone to this new phone' and everything was automated after that!

This is still a problem but today I have encountered another  issue wherein the phone will not stop rebooting. It still does it in safe mode and the battery charger trick didn't do it either. Which means I will have to do another factory reset on this phone. The only reason this review has more than one star is because I used to be a Samsung stan before I got the pixel.

Unfortunately I will have to return it because it seems to be either defective or too cheaply made with too many corners cut. First of all' the haptic feedback and vibration in general is very weak and doesn't feel as punchy as on S9+. Second of all' the display has worse color uniformity' you can notice the differently colored display areas at all angles. Last but most important - the automatic brightness is either buggy or completely broken' the phone decreases the brightness every time I lock it and when I unlock it - it does not increase the brightness to previous value (even in same room lighting) and keeps display very dim unless I am in a very bright room. This phone is not worth its current price for me with all the issues I have seen.,Reviewed in the United States on 22 August 2021

Initially' I didn't like that it didn't include Wifi calling but that was eventually added to my surprise during an update.  This was huge since my mom lives in bad cell phone coverage area.  The battery is excellent.  I haven't received any negative audio comments from anyone during voice call.  The camera is excellent.  Although it has 5G capability' I don't know when or if it is in use - It lacks an icon.  Oh' the top "ribbon" is a little tough to read.  Its a great phone and at a great price.  My wife likes it more than her iPhone.,Reviewed in the United States on 12 April 2021

It's fast' stable' and feature packed.  I replaced an older LG G8 and this is my first Samsung phone since the original Galaxy (which I was horrible for me).  I bought this because it supports an SD Card and was otherwise a relatively inexpensive' yet full featured phone.If I have one notable complaint' it's how the camera physically protrudes from the phone.  Not much' but it prevents it from sitting flat on a surface (unless I have it in a case).  This might be necessary for the camera's features and the "thinness" of the phone' but it makes me concerned about scratching the camera glass.  While there are glass screen protectors for the camera glass' they don't stay on well unless appropriately protected in a case.Overall very good' but I don't like how the phone makes me concerned about damaging the camera area and doesn't otherwise sit flat outside of a case.,Reviewed in the United States on 20 November 2021

This phone was reasonably priced and had all the features I was looking for. I put a glass screen protector on it as soon as I got it and a gel type case. I will say though' the glass screen protector does affect fingerprint recognition somewhat. Out of the box' the fingerprint sensor works great' but with the screen protector' it misreads the fingerprint maybe 1/5 of the time. But that’s not a limitation on the phone' just the screen protector. Otherwise I’m very happy. Display is beautiful and battery life is amazing!,Reviewed in the United States on 7 April 2021

You can't get it warrantied through Samsung unless the proof of purchase has the IMEI number on it.  I had to send my phone in twice to try and get repaired.

Overall it's a good camera.  It's not the best camera out the'  but it does a very fine job of trying to be the best. Many filters and functions await you here.The battery is impressive.  I'm kinda hard on my phone battery'  and this one could take the abuse. Fairly quick charging off a wall jack or portable battery with plenty of active use time.  You get more features here too with power sharing and highly tunable battery saving options.All in all'  I'm very satisfied with the phone and I'm sure many others feel the same.P.S.

This phone will not let me have conversations for over 5 minutes on some occasions I've gotten 10 minutes.  When it started cutting me off is was not often but now I can not keep any conversation without being cut off.

The battery life is impeccable for me! I am a young person. That being said' I am on my phone very often. I have watched hours of movies' YouTube videos' and shows. I am not much of a tech nerd but I can say that compared to my old phone the battery lasts more than all day' after countless hours using it.I originally bought this type of phone because I hoped that it would not be obsolete in two years like my old LG K10. I also bought this phone for it's DeX feature. You can basically turn your phone into a computer desktop if you have a projector or desktop computer/laptop using an HDMI cord to type-C. This is an awesome device! The screen is very colorful and watching videos on it is perfect!I must say that this phones fingerprint reader is horrendous. It has only read my fingerprint about 62% of the time. I really do not care about it' because my old phone never even had that feature. I have not tried the face recognition feature yet.Something that I do not like is the back camera sticks out from the phone a little. I would recommend you get a phone case right away' or at least get camera and screen protectors ASAP. If you drop your phone one good time without a case and protectors' your whole phone would probably malfunction. The cameras I think would shatter internally.,Reviewed in the United States on 3 August 2021

Mild use of phone daily and battery is still 89% at the end of the day. Comes with battery option to stop charging at 85% to save your battery as well if you're interested. Great features all around. No 3.5mm but USB C dongle works just fine if you buy one separately. Can hook up USBC to HDMI and use it like it's own little computer or stream to a TV which is crazy.

According to my husband this was good phone. I went ahead and bought it. It's been a while since I've paid a lot for a cell phone because all I needed it for mainly was for calling/ texting/ pictures. Since my old phone doesn't take good pictures I asked my husband for a camera or a better cell phone that took good pictures. Everything went fine until I wasn't able to download or accept group messages or pictures. Also' I usually listen to music on my way home from work and Pandora didn't work at all. It kept skipping the music and at times it would work' but other times it wouldn't. I spoke to a Amazon Tech' I went online on google to look for ways to try and fix these issues. I restarted the phone' clear the data' the cache. I tried everything I could and it wasn't working. I returned it because I want a phone that actually works.

Fingerprint reader isn't great with glass screen protector and for some reason all glass screen protectors come with a hole for the front facing camera so fuzz builds up making the image quality poor.I have no qualms with the phone itself though.

Microphone is clear' speaker volume is much louder' things load fast' it's waterproof'' etc etc. But the Samsung version of Android is extremely annoying to use. My typing is slower than ever' I often must repeat touch inputs multiple times. Fingerprint reader works fine though your fingertip must be at just the right angle' flat to the screen. Auto brightness adjust is awful and when unlocking the phone in a dark room it will flash super bright in your face before correcting. Phone is just large enough that one-handing is difficult' which causes me to tap things I didn't want to and drop it more.

I am not a camera connoisseur so I can't comment on whether the camera is all that it's supposed to be but it seems good. I will say that both the fingerprint reader and the face recognition our spotty at best. I often need to use my unlock code but that is easy. I've only had it a couple of months but so far so good.

Don't let my lack of rating some of the options make you think that there is something wrong with them. I haven't fully gotten into those options so it would be unfair of me to rate them.
